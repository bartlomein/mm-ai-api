1. Dave Hyde: A good workday for Zach Wilson, not for Dolphins' physical work

Mike McDaniel had a decision to make Saturday. He knows by now you can't talk a team's desired identity or reformed culture into existence. It has to be created with work, not words.

That's why he practiced two days and played Saturday's exhibition against the Detroit Lions. How better to move your identity from finesse to physical than working against one of the toughest teams led by a coach who professes to eat kneecaps?

Only on Saturday, in a workout of mostly backups, McDaniel dropped the demands toward a newer, tougher identity in the first half.

The Dolphins ran just five times for 6 yards.

Quarterback Zach Wilson, meanwhile, passed for 23 times that half, completing 15 for 151 yards and a touchdown.

McDaniel's intentions were as clear as his play calls. He wanted the roster's second most important player to get in a good day's work.

Wilson's individual development in this offense was more important Saturday than the larger team's daily, seasoning process toward a changed identity as shown by a big running game. That's because three of the past four seasons have involved Tua Tagovailoa injuries that meant the season's fate fell to his backup.

That's why Wilson is watched closer than any backup in the league. It's why this decision is more important than any made this Dolphins offseason.

Here's the good news: He was more comfortable in the offense than last week in Chicago. Maybe it was just knocking off some rust since he didn't throw a pass in Denver last season. But Wilson was better Saturday than a week ago in the tie against the Bears when he wanted several passes back.

This time, it was just one, a deep pass on first down -- just the way the Dolphins' identity was the past couple of years -- that was so severely underthrown to Dee Eskridge a would-be touchdown that became an incompletion.

It's a tough translation, judging how Wilson's preseason play with backups projects toward how he could be in the third regular-season game, as was needed of backup Skyler Thompson last season. It's easier to see there's problems at cornerback, that the defensive line is deep, that there are backup receivers with some talent.

"There was some growth," McDaniel said of Wilson on CBS Miami at halftime. "We had two long drives in particular, the 80-yard touchdown drive was good. There was some resolve he showed. He kind of got in the huddle and took charge, so that's what we want to see."

Good, fundamental quarterback work. That's what Saturday was about. McDaniel has to get to know Wilson, too, in workouts like this. What patterns he likes to throw. Which plays he can work. McDaniel handed him the offense to run from long balls to receiver screens to a toss sweeps to a receiver in motion.

It was Eskridge much of Saturday's first half, and he did fine with three catches for 53 yards. His good toss-sweep run was called back by penalty. But tight end Tanner Conner had six catches for 48 yards, too.

This is Wilson's job, too, no matter how rookie Quinn Ewers fares. Ewers was fine Saturday, filling the second half in a more balanced offense. Ewers threw 17 passes for 116 yards, and the Dolphins ran a more responsible 14 times for 92 yards.

But this is Wilson's job behind Tagovailoa, just as it has been since he signed for $6 million. You see why McDaniel wanted a former No. 2 draft pick of the New York Jets.

You also wonder why Denver coach Sean Payton made him the third quarterback last year behind Bo Nix and Jarrett Stidham. And wanted Stidham this offseason.

Wilson could be the next Sam Darnold or Geno Smith, a quarterback leaving the New York Jets and recapturing a good career. That's what this season could be about.

Saturday was about building his comfort and confidence in a workout. He threw 23 times and handed off just five. One was a third-and-one dive by Jaylen Wright for a first down after measurement. Whew.

Developing a new, physical identity with the running game matters, McDaniel has decided since last season.

But the state of the backup quarterback mattered more Saturday for good reason.

3. Put safety first at North Perry Airport | Letters to the editor

According to a recent report by WLRN about paying for a modern new control tower at North Perry Airport, Broward County aviation officials are recommending the county decline a $358,000 state grant (they want the feds to pay for it).

This is days after the Pembroke Pines City Commission unanimously passed a resolution asking the county, which owns the airport, to conduct an airport safety study. WLRN mentions 41 aircraft connected to North Perry that were involved in accidents over the past five years.

I'm curious if county commissioners are tone deaf to residents of a community who are outraged over the number of accidents and frightened that a small plane could end up in their homes.

Or will commissioners find the money for a new control tower -- just like they found $4.2 million a few years ago to buy a nice new scoreboard for the Florida Panthers (who are owned by a billionaire)? Let's see how important they consider public safety.

Raphael Borrero, Pembroke Pines

The U.S. Constitution calls for the direct election of members of Congress, but the states set the rules, including the boundaries for all 435 congressional districts.

Districts are subject to gerrymandering by those who draw the lines. When severe gerrymandering occurs, the consequences are usually limited to the residents of that state. But when a state like Texas takes gerrymandering to a new extreme with a mid-census-cycle reapportionment of districts, we would all be directly affected by the changing composition of a House that no longer reflects the will of the people.

If Democratic-led states respond to Texas by doing the same thing to offset a Republican advantage, the result will be a House that's even more partisan, and that can't be good.

The long-term solution is federal legislation with objective standards for drawing districts. Incentives could be offered to states, such as federal reimbursement of the costs of federal elections. Approaches should be used to establish unbiased, objective, fair districts, such as excluding party affiliation, race, and national origin from criteria.

A computer-generated formula could combine adjoining census tracts to reach targeted population counts (about 760,000 residents per district in 2020) to avoid these nonsensical shapes that result from cherry-picking targeted voters.

Vice President JD Vance accused the UK of going down a "very dark path" of online censorship for implementing its Online Safety Act to prevent children from accessing potentially harmful materials online.

These accusations seem ludicrous, coming from an administration that fires federal workers for telling the truth, punishes news reporters and lawyers for doing their jobs and pardons MAGA thugs for attacking the U.S. Capitol.

Such actions are what historians for decades have warned believers of freedom, democracy and our Constitution about.

The founding principles of our democracy are being trampled by Republican MAGA cartels.

Separation of church and state, three co-equal pillars of government, the rule of law and the concept of noble U.S. government service have been cast aside. Never before has a U.S. administration been so blatant. Transactional Republicans use government and religion to control the public and make money.

It is crucial, now more than ever, that Congress protect Social Security.

Democrats, Republicans and independents must find common ground to make solvent and hopefully increase future monthly payments to keep pace with the cost of living and inflation. Seniors depend on this entitlement that each of them has paid into for their golden years. Many seniors have a difficult time making ends meet. For many, Social Security may be their only source of income.

6. Protests in Serbia Leave 6 Policemen Injured, 56 People Detained

Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic told a briefing at night that 18 rioters had been detained in Valjevo and other cities, but the figure was not definitive. "During yesterday's uncoordinated actions, a total of 6 police officers were injured, 56 people were detained - 16 of them on reasonable suspicion of committing criminal offenses... while 35 more people were detained for committing administrative offenses," the ministry said in a statement. Among the detainees, 27 were in Belgrade and 29 in Valjevo. Mass protests in Valjevo, 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Belgrade, started on Saturday evening after a video went viral on social media depicting harsh police actions against demonstrators in this city in the previous days. In the early hours of Sunday, the offices of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party and partner parties, the city administration, the court, and the prosecutor's office were attacked. Violent protests also occurred in the Novi Beograd district of the capital of Serbia, where the police used tear gas. The office of the Serbian Progressive Party of Vojislav Seselj, who publicly spoke out against the demonstrators, was also attacked in the Zemun district. There, windows were broken and walls were doused with paint. Incidents at protests were reported on social media and news from the cities of Novi Sad, Leskovac, Vranje. The Serbian Interior Ministry has not yet issued a statement. Last night, six police officers were injured and 38 people were detained during riots across Serbia. Unknown persons destroyed the office of the Serbian Progressive Party in Novi Sad on Friday night, and incidents occurred near party offices in Belgrade and other cities. Serbian Prime Minister Duro Macut condemned the violence and called for a reduction in tension. Serbian Patriarch Porfirije called on his fellow citizens to stop conflicts and discord. The Serbian Justice Ministry called the riots a blow to the constitutional order and warned of criminal liability for those involved. The ministry recalled that the constitution and laws of Serbia criminalized physical attacks, intimidation and threats on political grounds and that those committing them would be identified and punished according to the criminal code. Student and opposition protests began in Serbia after the collapse of a canopy at the Novi Sad train station on November 1, 2024, which resulted in the death of 16 people.


7. Mac Engel: LIV Golf-PGA Tour marriage looks like it will never walk down the aisle

INDIANAPOLIS -- Saudi Arabia's attempt to whiten its reputation through professional golf is the example of the terrible golfer who has all of the expensive equipment, latest gear and shoots 19-over par.

The $500 driver doesn't convince anyone the guy swinging the club has a clue how to use it.

It is appropriate that the third year of LIV Golf is winding down its 2025 season in the city known as the Crossroads of America, which is exactly where this ambitious/expensive/controversial startup sits. Its second-to-last tournament of its season is this weekend in Indianapolis, played at a course you've never heard of in an event that you didn't know, or care, exists.

Gauged by the locals in Indianapolis, a city (and state) that seldom has hosted major pro golf tournaments is currently more interested in, in order, Indiana Fever games, Caitlin Clark injury updates, Indianapolis Colts preseason news, Indiana Pacers 2025 NBA playoff highlights, Indiana Hoosiers football, Notre Dame women's basketball, Purdue men's basketball recruiting, Indiana State baseball, Ball State kickball, Depauw University women's golf, Wabash College wrestling, LIV Golf.

While the backlash of this tour funded by Saudi Arabia's massive pile of money has mostly faded, the audience remains mostly a crowd looking for something to do. They don't care who wins. They aren't paying attention to the new rules. They probably don't even know who is playing.

Because it's supported by Saudi Arabia's inexhaustible PIF fund, LIV Golf can outlive both Keith Richards and the heartiest cockroach. And the PGA Tour will ultimately win this boring battles of millionaires versus millionaires, lawyers versus lawyers, a Royal family and a president, too.

Roughly one year ago, former PGA Tour and current LIV golfer Ian Poulter issued this dire warning to myself at the end of an interview: "Not next year." This was in response to an innocent question about when the once imminent merger between the PGA Tour and LIV would actually be complete.

It's a year later, and Poulter's answer still applies.

Norman, Mickelson win. But who else?

In June of 2023, a few powerful members of the PGA Tour succumbed to the perceived financial pressure wielded by LIV to announce it would merge with the new league that was buying the top names in the sport. The announcement was a major win for the Saudi family, former PGA Tour star Greg Norman and the Tour players who left for LIV in exchange for amounts of money that didn't seem possible.

We are more than two years removed from that announcement, and still no closer to The Announcement. We should no longer expect one.

The winners here are Norman and his buddy Phil Mickelson. Norman already hated the PGA Tour long before he became a prominent face of LIV; Mickelson bailed on the Tour because of ... "spending habits."

LIV has added more tournaments to it schedule, and it is aggressive in the markets that host events to try to bring in the crowds. As a golf product, it's not bad.

It negotiated a multi-year broadcast agreement with Fox Sports to air half of its tournaments across several of that network's channels. Unlike LIV's previous broadcast right's agreement with the CW, which was a revenue-sharing deal, Fox reportedly did pay a fee to carry these tournaments.

DeChambeau, others lose spotlight

This is all progress for a startup sports league. To the average golf fan, all of this progress means they now see the names that were once the most prominent in the sport but three to four times a year. Golf fans aren't taking LIV seriously, and the irrelevance of the league is impossible to dismiss.

The other PGA Tour stars who left, like Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Jon Rahm, Bubba Watson, Patrick Reed and the few others, got their money, and inclusion to the majors. These are big wins, but in return they became obscure golfers who offer nothing to potential sponsors.

This has been the one element to this crippling adventure that the LIV golfers badly misread. As much money as a pro golfer can make in prize money, the big, easy, cash is in endorsements. LIV golfers are not finding the same types, or any, opportunity to endorse anything.

Sponsors want eyeballs, and LIV isn't attracting many. Winning an LIV tournament doesn't make a player a star, or enhance a resume. Plus, there are just enough remnants of anger at players taking Saudi money that some potential sponsors don't want anything to do with it. There is a reason no company is a title sponsor of any of LIV's tournaments.

As much deserved anger and criticism that PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan received for his butchering of this whole situation from Day 1, in the last year-plus he has shown the good sense to read the room on this "merger."

There is no reason to move on a partnership, so he won't. He has one year remaining on his contract as commissioner, and it's likely he will leave this issue to his successor.

The most visible LIV players signed contracts that should be expiring in the next year, which means we are likely to see some of those names ask to rejoin the PGA Tour. Expect to hear grumblings about that early in 2026.

That reunion would potentially be messy, and lead to some nasty name calling, but professional golf is better when all of the names are concentrated in the same tournament rather than spread out over two leagues.

There is almost zero public support, or pressure, on the PGA Tour to make this merger happen.

Former PGA Tour player turned LIV golfer Lee Westwood's hope was the two leagues could "be side-by-side and occupy some of the golf ecosystem space." Golf is a niche sport and not big enough for competing leagues.

LIV Golf may live forever, but it's apparent it will never merge with the PGA Tour.

8. Economists expect tariffs lifted food prices, core inflation in July

OTTAWA -- Tariff impacts are expected to keep underlying inflation elevated in July, a Desjardins economist says, even if the headline figure retreats.

Statistics Canada is set to report inflation figures for July on Tuesday. A poll of economists expects annual inflation cooled last month to 1.7 per cent, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.

June's consumer price index showed the annual rate of inflation ticked up to 1.9 per cent.

Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins, said he expects the headline inflation figure slowed beyond expectations to 1.6 per cent in July as lower energy costs continue to take steam out of price pressures.

"We're kind of expecting it to be a bit softer than what we saw back in June. So, from a headline perspective anyway, that's overall pretty positive news for Canadians," he said in an interview.

RBC is above the economists' consensus, expecting July's annual inflation reading will match the 1.9 per cent seen in June.

Economists Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan wrote in a note to clients Friday that the removal of the consumer carbon price at the start of April "continues to artificially lower headline inflation."

But they warned that price pressures below the surface should remain stubborn in July.

"Underlying trends have surprised upward this year, partly due to tariff impacts on products like food and vehicles, but also from higher prices for domestic services," Janzen and Fan wrote.

The Bank of Canada's preferred metrics of core inflation floated a bit above three per cent in June, according to Statistics Canada.

Bartlett said Desjardins foresees these metrics holding between 2.5 per cent and three per cent for the rest of the year as Canada's tariff dispute with the United States drives up prices.

He said he'll be looking to see whether more businesses were passing costs from tariffs onto consumers in July.

Consumer price index data from the United States this past week appeared to show a tariff impact in the form of higher prices for shoes and furniture.

While he believes the bulk of tariff price impacts were passed through in April and May, Bartlett said Canada will continue to feel the pinch from border levies on food and durable goods.

"That's going to put persistent upward pressure on price growth in Canada," he said.

The Bank of Canada held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.75 per cent on July 30 as it waits for more information on how the Canada-U.S. trade dispute is affecting the economy.

The summary of deliberations from that decision released this past week show the central bank's governing council remains wary of the effect of tariffs on inflation.

Members indicated in those minutes that the impact on consumer prices "appeared to be modest so far," but the tariff influence is only just starting to show up in the data.

While businesses' inflation expectations remain well-anchored according to recent surveys, the governing council said the costs of finding new suppliers amid shifting global trade could still push prices higher.

"Overall, members agreed that it was still too early to assess how tariffs and the rewiring of trade would affect economic activity and inflation in Canada," the summary read.

Bartlett said he expects economic data will open the door to a quarter-point interest rate cut at the Bank of Canada's next decision on Sept. 17.

But that's contingent on core inflation readings getting back under control in the upcoming CPI releases for July and August.

"If we see that there's less passthrough from tariffs into inflation than we're expecting ... we think there there's an opportunity for the Bank of Canada to cut further," he said.

9. Zelensky claims Russia 'complicating' ceasefire efforts as PM meets allies

Russia is complicating efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to meet with European leaders to discuss the war.

The coalition of the willing, the alliance which is planning to police a future peace deal in Ukraine, will meet on Sunday afternoon amid reports Donald Trump favours a Russian land grab to end the war.

Following the Alaska summit between Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin on Friday, the American leader suggested he wants to move straight to a full peace deal, rather than negotiating a ceasefire first.

The shift in Mr Trump's position appears to echo the Russians' refusal to agree to ceasefire before engaging in peace talks.

Several news outlets have cited sources which claimed that during the negotiations Mr Putin demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops.

Other outlets reported that Mr Trump is inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelensky about it when they meet in the Oval Office.

Writing on social media on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian leader railed against Russia's refusal to lay down arms temporarily before agreeing to end the war.

Mr Zelensky said: "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing.

"This complicates the situation."

He added: "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades.

"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war."

The Prime Minister, alongside French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz, will host the coalition of the willing on Sunday afternoon.

The video conference will see allies who plan to keep the peace in Ukraine gather ahead of Mr Zelensky's visit to Washington on Monday.

The Ukrainian leader is expected to attend the Sunday afternoon video call, which is scheduled to take place at 2pm UK time.

Friday's summit between Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, ended without any commitment towards a ceasefire.

The Russian president described it as "timely" and "useful" after he left.

Mr Trump afterwards suggested it was time for Mr Zelensky to make a deal to end the war.

Sir Keir commended Mr Trump's "pursuit of an end to the killing", but insisted Ukraine's leader must not be excluded from future talks to broker a peace in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister and European leaders appeared increasingly confident that Mr Trump will offer a "security guarantee" of air support to back up allied troops on the ground in Ukraine, should they be deployed to keep the peace.

Experts have warned the face-to-face summit has risked legitimising the Russian leader, who has been made a pariah by the international community for invading Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky has warned Russia may ramp up its strikes against his country in the coming days "in order to create more favourable political circumstances for talks with global actors".

12. Appeal for 100th birthday cards for Second World War veteran - Liverpool Echo

A branch of the Royal Naval Association is appealing for well-wishers to send 100th birthday cards to a Second World War veteran who served in the Arctic Convoys to make his surprise celebration extra special. Dougie Shelley, who joined the Royal Navy aged 17, served as a seaman gunner and said earlier this year: "There's not many of us left."

The sailor, of Southend in Essex, was on a ship in Hong Kong when news came through of Germany's surrender, and said in a previous interview that it "couldn't have been better" The war killed so many people it's unbelievable," he said. "All around, the Americans, Russians, all the Allies, the same with the Germans.

"But you were doing a job, the same as they had to. It's either kill or be killed.

"When we heard about Victory in Europe, everybody got together and we all had a good old drink up and jolly up, and couldn't welcome it much better."

Mr Shelley, who has no known surviving family, will turn 100 on September 23.

John Hawes, chairman of the Southend branch of the Royal Naval Association, is appealing for people to send birthday cards for Mr Shelley, which will be collated at the local branch and shown to him at a party on the day.

The 76-year-old said Mr Shelley was the branch's "last Arctic convoy veteran and also he was at D-Day".

Mr Shelley's carer Paul Bennett said Mr Shelley was on the HMS Milne on D-Day "supporting the chaps going off to land in craft ashore in Normandy and he was a gunner keeping the skies clear of enemy aircraft".

Mr Hawes said the veteran had previously been the local branch's chairman, secretary and treasurer but "as he got older he had to stop some of those jobs".

"He's always been there, he's always got a smile, he always wants to chat," he said.

"He really deserves something, he has been one of our founder members way back in 1980 I think it was when the actual club opened.

"He's always been with us on the Remembrance Sunday in his wheelchair and somebody's pushed him up to the cenotaph at Southend."

He is hoping to collate at least 100 birthday cards for Mr Shelley.

"I think he's going to thoroughly enjoy it, he really will, he'll be over the moon," said Mr Hawes.

"Dougie always likes to let everybody know he's there and this will blow his socks off I think."

Mr Hawes, who was a chef and baker on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, is to make Mr Shelley's birthday cake - a Victoria sandwich.

He said Mr Shelley "does like his tot of rum" and that this would be offered to guests, with a bottle of Pusser's Rum presented to the veteran.

Mr Hawes asked for birthday cards for Mr Shelley to be sent to the Royal Naval Association club, 73-79 East Street, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, SS2 6LQ.


13. Two Florida Gators included on The Athletic's 2025 college football 'Freak List'

Anyone who has ever stood next to a college football player knows they possess some freakish athletic and physical abilities, but there are those who stand out among the pack as truly rare specimens.

The Athletic aims to identify the top 100 freakiest college football players going into each season, and a pair of Florida Gators cracked the list. Freshman edge rusher Jayden Woods checks in at No. 40, and starting running back Jadan Baugh is No. 53, according to national college football insider Bruce Feldman.

Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith sits in the top spot, followed by Alabama offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor and South Carolina receiver Nyck Harbor. The remainder of the top 10 are mostly defensive tackles, two of which are in the SEC. The conference boasts 19 freaks overall.

One of the biggest wins for Billy Napier and Florida during the last recruiting cycle came when he flipped top-100-ranked edge rusher Jayden Woods from Penn State. It takes a beast to play on the edge in the SEC, and Woods fits that definition. However, he also profiles well as an interior defensive lineman. That versatility could lead to some early playing time.

"The four-star recruit from Kansas, who was a 6A state champion in shot put and discus, has added 15 pounds since arriving last winter," Feldman said. "Woods has wowed coaches with his explosiveness, intelligence and work ethic. At 6-3, 244, Woods broad jumped 10-5 this offseason and vertical jumped 33.5 inches. His shuttle time was 4.28. He squatted 555 pounds and power cleaned 365. ILB Aaron Chiles is another similarly sized Freaky defender. The 243-pound sophomore vertical jumped 9-10 1/2 and cleaned 345 pounds at 243."

Jadan Baugh was already one of the more exciting pieces of Florida's offense after a break second half last year, but the Gators' strength and conditioning coach added to those expectations with heavy praise following summer workouts. Baugh challenged and broke several program lifting records, both pound-for-pound and overall.

"As a true freshman, Baugh gave the Gators a huge spark in the second half of the season, shining against Georgia, Texas, LSU and Ole Miss. He also had big performances against FSU and Kentucky, when he had a program-record five rushing TDs," Feldman said. "Baugh led the Gators with 673 yards, averaging over five yards per carry to go with eight TDs. The 6-1, 233-pound power back from Atlanta, who has 13.6 percent body fat, squatted 565 pounds this offseason, did a close-grip bench press of 350 and cleaned 335. He also moves well for such a big back, hitting 21.7 mph."

It was another productive summer in the gym for the Gators. Strength and conditioning coach Tyler Miles spoke to the media ahead of fall training camp, and lauded the team's work ethic. Sixty-five percent of the team gained muscle and lost fat.

"We gained 700 pounds of muscle this offseason. Last year was 580, so we gained 120 pounds more than last offseason, and we lost 200 somewhat pounds of fat, somewhere in the two hundreds," Miles said. "We didn't lose as much fat this year, but we didn't have as much fat to lose."

It's hard to pick a so-called freak out of an SEC weight room without being in the room, but it's usally the second-year guys who develop the most physically. LJ McCray fits the bill, and he added "like 40 pounds" both in weight and to his bench press personal record.

DJ Lagway is another rare specimen. He shook off SEC pass rushers with relative ease as a true freshman, and he should be healthier and stronger this year. A couple of highlight reel scrambles might earn him a spot on this list next year.

14. Former bogus self-employed RT√â worker loses WRC case

A former bogus self-employed worker at RT√â has lost his claim to retrospective pay and holiday entitlements from the broadcaster as a result of the misclassification of his employment status for over six years.

The Workplace Relations Commission ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear complaints made by RT√â employee Joseph Kelly in relation to his former employment status because they had been submitted outside the statutory timeframe.

Mr Kelly claimed he was originally required by RT√â to register as a contractor with Revenue when he started working with the national broadcaster in September 2012.

He claimed he lost out on entitlements to annual leave, sick leave, public holidays and incremental salary increases as a consequence of having to become self-employed.

Represented by a lay advisor, Martin McMahon, Mr Kelly sought to have his loss of earnings for a period of just over six years corrected and the necessary adjustments to his current salary scale.

Eight separate claims, which were lodged with the WRC on 9 October 2024, were brought under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.

However, solicitor for RT√â S√©amus Given of Arthur Cox LLP, submitted that the cognisable period given the six-month statutory limitation of the legislation governing claims to the WRC was from April 10, 2024.

Mr Given argued that Mr Kelly had been properly paid and given all his public holiday and annual leave entitlements over the relevant period.

He also claimed that the WRC had no jurisdiction to hear or extend the time limit for submitting a complaint beyond a 12-month period.

The WRC heard that Mr Kelly was hired as an independent contractor in September 2012 and paid ‚Ç¨200 per day as a media content coordinator before being made an employee of RT√â on 12 November 2018.

He currently works as a news coordinator placed on point 12 of a 14-point salary scale which ranges from ‚Ç¨37,567 to ‚Ç¨59,862.

Mr McMahon pointed out that the matter of bogus self-employment among workers at RT√â was the subject of a review by an independent law firm as well as a review by the Department of Social Protection.

He told the WRC that Mr Kelly was unaware of these reviews which resulted in RT√â having to make a payment of approximately ‚Ç¨30,000 to the Department of Social Protection to regularise his PRSI contributions.

Mr McMahon said it had also led to Mr Kelly losing out on any entitlements to pay for working Sundays and public holidays as well as annual and sick leave and any other entitlement that permanent employees had.

He claimed Mr Kelly was continuing to lose out due to the consequences of his initial employment misclassification.

Mr McMahon said the complainant had made numerous efforts to resolve these matters without success.

He argued that Mr Kelly was seeking to have his entitlements rectified and regularised so that he did not suffer any loss for the error which RT√â accepted it had made.

In his ruling, Mr Harraghy noted that Mr Kelly had provided extensive documentation in relation to the context and background of his claim and his attempts to seek a resolution with his employer.

The WRC adjudicator said it was clear that Mr Kelly and Mr McMahon had committed a considerable amount of time and research on the issue.

He observed that all the issues that were the subject of his complaints related to the period covering his employment status up to November 2018 when he was not afforded any of the rights that an employee would have accrued.

However, Mr Harraghy said his role was to apply the law to the facts but he could only consider complaints submitted within the statutory timeframe provided for by the relevant legislation.

He observed that WRC adjudication officers were not empowered to modify timeframes or accept complaints which fell outside timeframes outlined by law.

For that reason, Mr Harraghy said he had no jurisdiction to consider the complaints made by Mr Kelly.

During a two-day hearing which took place in December 2024 and June 2025, RT√â was accused of engaging in "sharp practice" and attempting to "run down the clock" on a commitment to compensate those who had lost money as a result of bogus self-employment.

Mr Kelly said that when he joined RT√â in 2012 that the HR section told him he had to become a sole trader which also meant he was not allowed to apply for internal jobs at RT√â.

A senior HR manager at RT√â, Angela McEvoy, said RT√â had accepted a decision by the Department of Social Protection in relation to Mr Kelly's PRSI insurability.

However, Ms McEvoy rejected the suggestion by Mr McMahon that RT√â had got Mr Kelly to misrepresent himself to Revenue.

Mr McMahon told the WRC that it was "not acceptable" for RT√â to promise to follow the recommendations of an expert report in relation to bogus self-employed workers and now claim Mr Kelly's case was "out of time."

17. Zelensky claims Russia 'complicating' ceasefire efforts as PM meets allies

Russia is complicating efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to meet with European leaders to discuss the war.

The coalition of the willing, the alliance which is planning to police a future peace deal in Ukraine, will meet on Sunday afternoon amid reports Donald Trump favours a Russian land grab to end the war.

Following the Alaska summit between Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin on Friday, the American leader suggested he wants to move straight to a full peace deal, rather than negotiating a ceasefire first.

The shift in Mr Trump's position appears to echo the Russians' refusal to agree to ceasefire before engaging in peace talks.

Several news outlets have cited sources which claimed that during the negotiations Mr Putin demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops.

Other outlets reported that Mr Trump is inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelensky about it when they meet in the Oval Office.

Writing on social media on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian leader railed against Russia's refusal to lay down arms temporarily before agreeing to end the war.

Mr Zelensky said: "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing.

"This complicates the situation."

He added: "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades.

"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war."

The Prime Minister, alongside French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz, will host the coalition of the willing on Sunday afternoon.

The video conference will see allies who plan to keep the peace in Ukraine gather ahead of Mr Zelensky's visit to Washington on Monday.

The Ukrainian leader is expected to attend the Sunday afternoon video call, which is scheduled to take place at 2pm UK time.

Friday's summit between Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, ended without any commitment towards a ceasefire.

The Russian president described it as "timely" and "useful" after he left.

Mr Trump afterwards suggested it was time for Mr Zelensky to make a deal to end the war.

Sir Keir commended Mr Trump's "pursuit of an end to the killing", but insisted Ukraine's leader must not be excluded from future talks to broker a peace in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister and European leaders appeared increasingly confident that Mr Trump will offer a "security guarantee" of air support to back up allied troops on the ground in Ukraine, should they be deployed to keep the peace.

Experts have warned the face-to-face summit has risked legitimising the Russian leader, who has been made a pariah by the international community for invading Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky has warned Russia may ramp up its strikes against his country in the coming days "in order to create more favourable political circumstances for talks with global actors".


18. Jerry Yan visits Barbie Hsu's resting place in Taiwan - Manila Standard

Taiwanese actor Jerry Yan recently visited the final resting place of his Meteor Garden co-star Barbie Hsu in New Taipei.

Yan, who rose to fame as Dao Ming Si in the hit 2001 drama, was reportedly accompanied by friends during the visit last week, according to a report from Next Apple News.

Hsu, remembered for her role as Shan Cai opposite Yan, died in February of pneumonia at the age of 48.

Following her passing, Yan, fellow F4 member Ken Chu, and actress Rainie Yang shared heartfelt tributes on social media.

In July, Yan reunited with his F4 bandmates -- Ken Chu, Vic Chou, and Vanness Wu -- at Mayday's 25th anniversary concert in Taiwan, where they performed the theme song of their iconic drama, Meteor Rain.

20. Vegas Advisor: Plan halted to build $270 million casino | Honolulu Star-Advertiser

Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser subscriber? Log in now to continue reading.

One of Las Vegas' biggest pending projects has been taken off the table. Restaurateur and owner of the Golden Nugget casinos, Tilman Fertitta, has aborted his plan to build a $270 million casino on a six-acre parcel at the corner of Harmon Avenue and the Strip. While a slumping Las Vegas economy and Fertitta's preoccupation with his appointment as the U.S. ambassador to Italy likely contributed to the decision, his status as the largest stockholder in Wynn Resorts was cited as the primary reason. A Fertitta spokesperson issued a statement saying that "building a competing high-end resort only a mile down the street would be a conflict of interest." The vacant property has been turned into a parking lot and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

Tables gone: Downtown's Golden Gate has announced that it's eliminating live table games. The live games will be replaced with electronic versions of blackjack, craps, roulette and possibly some "carnival games." It's not all bad news for table-games players, as the interfaces of the electronic games have improved markedly in recent years and often come with lower minimum-bet requirements. The changeover is expected to be completed by the end of September.

Boomer's opens: The first Las Vegas location of several planned Boomer's Sportsbooks has opened at Ellis Island. Its current location in the casino is temporary, as a bigger presence will be incorporated into a redesign of the casino that's currently in progress.

Question: Is the Nevada representative in the Little League World Series from Las Vegas?

Answer: Yes. Summerlin South is an all-star collection of area players. The team made it all the way to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., as the Mountain region representative among the final 20 teams from around the world.

1. European leaders to meet on Ukraine as Zelenskiy prepares to face Trump

European leaders are planning to bolster Ukraine's position before a crucial meeting. Volodymyr Zelenskiy will meet Donald Trump in Washington. Trump is urging Kyiv to consider a deal to end the war. This follows Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin. European powers aim to ensure Ukraine's involvement in shaping its future.

The leaders of France, Germany and Britain will try to shore up Ukraine's position on Sunday as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy prepares to meet Donald Trump in Washington with the U.S. leader pressing Kyiv to accept a deal to end the war.

President Trump is leaning on Ukraine to strike an agreement after meeting Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska where, according to sources, the Russian president offered to relinquish tiny pockets of occupied Ukraine in exchange for vast swathes elsewhere.

At face value, some of Putin's demands would be hugely difficult for Ukraine to accept, setting the stage for potentially fraught talks about ending Europe's deadliest war in 80 years, which has killed or wounded more than 1 million people.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will host a virtual meeting of the "coalition of the willing" - a grouping of allies of Kyiv - from 1300 GMT.

European powers want to help set up a trilateral meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelenskiy to make sure Ukraine has a seat at the table to shape its future.

They also want robust security guarantees for Ukraine with U.S. involvement, and the ability to crank up pressure on Moscow if needed.

"They will spell out what they consider essential in terms of security guarantees: what they can do themselves, what falls to the coalition of volunteers, and also what they expect from the United States," a European government official said. "Indeed, they expect a very robust commitment."

One or more of the European leaders could also accompany Zelenskiy when he flies to Washington on Monday for his meeting with Trump.

Trump said on Saturday that Ukraine should make a deal to end the war with Russia because "Russia is a very big power, and they're not".

After the Alaska summit with Putin, Trump phoned Zelenskiy and told him that the Kremlin chief had offered to freeze most front lines if Kyiv ceded all of Donetsk, the industrial region that is one of Moscow's main targets, a source familiar with the matter said.

Zelenskiy rejected the demand, the source said. Russia already controls a fifth of Ukraine, including about three-quarters of Donetsk province, which it first entered in 2014.

Trump also said he agreed with Putin that a peace deal should be sought without the prior ceasefire that Ukraine and its European allies have called for. That was a reversal of his position before the summit, when he said he would not be happy unless a ceasefire was agreed on.

Zelenskiy said Russia's unwillingness to pause the fighting would complicate efforts to forge a lasting peace. "Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war," he said on X.

Ukraine's air force said Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with 60 drones and one ballistic missile. It said it downed or jammed 40 of the drones.

Zelenskiy's last Oval Office meeting, in February, went disastrously, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance giving the Ukrainian leader a strong public dressing-down.

Merz said he did not think Zelenskiy would face as difficult a time this time around, adding that Zelenskiy would talk on Sunday to European leaders who would help him prepare for the meeting.

"We'll give a few good pieces of advice," he told German broadcaster n-tv.

Merz told ZDF that while it was important that Europe stand united, the U.S. would for the time being continue to play the decisive role in the war.

"The American president has the power both militarily and via appropriate sanctions and tariffs to ensure that Russia moves more than it currently does," he said.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been gradually advancing for months.

In his statement after the Alaska summit, Putin signalled no movement in Russia's long-held demands, which also include a veto on Kyiv's desired membership in the NATO alliance.

Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's national security adviser during part of Trump's first term, said the summit was a "clear win" for Putin because Trump dropped his previous call for an immediate ceasefire.

However, he added that it was positive that there appeared to be some willingness from the U.S. to be involved in offering some security guarantees for Ukraine.

"That is absolutely critical because apart from the issues of land swaps, which is a very complicated issue, the most important longer-term issue is the security guarantees for what is left of Ukraine, so Putin doesn't do what he normally does, which is have a time to rearm and come back for more at a later stage," he told Reuters.


2. Pakistan's Ashab Irfan advances to Jones Creek Open final

KARACHI: Pakistan's Ashab Irfan on Sunday advanced to the final of the ongoing Jones Creek Open Squash in the United States, while compatriot Asim Khan was ousted in the semi-finals.

In the semi-final clash of the $12,000 prize-money event, Ashab defeated Brazil's Diogo Gobbi 3-1 in a 53-minute encounter, winning the games 11-7, 14-12, 4-11, and 11-5.

Meanwhile, top-seed Asim suffered a surprise defeat against Malaysia's Nathan Chua, losing 3-1 with scores of 11-9, 4-11, 11-7, and 11-9.

Earlier on Saturday, both Pakistani players had delivered impressive performances to reach the semi-finals.

Asim overcame Egypt's Omar El Kattan 3-1 in a 46-minute quarterfinal, with game scores of 10-12, 11-3, 11-3, 13-11.

Ashab dominated Mexico's Cesar Segundo 3-0 in his quarterfinal, winning 11-3, 11-8, 11-3.

Both players had also secured their quarterfinal berths with strong second-round performances on Thursday.

Top-seed Asim defeated Egypt's Kareem Badawi 3-1 in 45 minutes (11-3, 11-6, 5-11, 11-8), while second-seed Ashab Irfan dismantled American Christopher Gordon in just 20 minutes (11-2, 11-4, 11-4), showcasing aggressive shot-making and high-paced play.

Meanwhile, Pakistan's Ahsan Ayaz and Muhammad Huzaifa Ibrahim were eliminated earlier. Seventh-seed Ahsan lost a five-game thriller against Omar El Kattan, falling 11-4, 10-12, 9-11, 11-8, 8-11 in 58 minutes.

Huzaifa bowed out in the round of 16, defeated by Brazil's third-seed Diego Gobbi 9-11, 11-3, 11-4, 11-6 in 47 minutes, despite winning the opening game.


3. Economists expect tariffs lifted food prices, core inflation in July

OTTAWA -- Tariff impacts are expected to keep underlying inflation elevated in July, a Desjardins economist says, even if the headline figure retreats.

Statistics Canada is set to report inflation figures for July on Tuesday. A poll of economists expects annual inflation cooled last month to 1.7 per cent, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.

June's consumer price index showed the annual rate of inflation ticked up to 1.9 per cent.

Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins, said he expects the headline inflation figure slowed beyond expectations to 1.6 per cent in July as lower energy costs continue to take steam out of price pressures.

"We're kind of expecting it to be a bit softer than what we saw back in June. So, from a headline perspective anyway, that's overall pretty positive news for Canadians," he said in an interview.

RBC is above the economists' consensus, expecting July's annual inflation reading will match the 1.9 per cent seen in June.

Economists Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan wrote in a note to clients Friday that the removal of the consumer carbon price at the start of April "continues to artificially lower headline inflation."

But they warned that price pressures below the surface should remain stubborn in July.

"Underlying trends have surprised upward this year, partly due to tariff impacts on products like food and vehicles, but also from higher prices for domestic services," Janzen and Fan wrote.

The Bank of Canada's preferred metrics of core inflation floated a bit above three per cent in June, according to Statistics Canada.

Bartlett said Desjardins foresees these metrics holding between 2.5 per cent and three per cent for the rest of the year as Canada's tariff dispute with the United States drives up prices.

He said he'll be looking to see whether more businesses were passing costs from tariffs onto consumers in July.

Consumer price index data from the United States this past week appeared to show a tariff impact in the form of higher prices for shoes and furniture.

While he believes the bulk of tariff price impacts were passed through in April and May, Bartlett said Canada will continue to feel the pinch from border levies on food and durable goods.

"That's going to put persistent upward pressure on price growth in Canada," he said.

The Bank of Canada held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.75 per cent on July 30 as it waits for more information on how the Canada-U.S. trade dispute is affecting the economy.

The summary of deliberations from that decision released this past week show the central bank's governing council remains wary of the effect of tariffs on inflation.

Members indicated in those minutes that the impact on consumer prices "appeared to be modest so far," but the tariff influence is only just starting to show up in the data.

While businesses' inflation expectations remain well-anchored according to recent surveys, the governing council said the costs of finding new suppliers amid shifting global trade could still push prices higher.

"Overall, members agreed that it was still too early to assess how tariffs and the rewiring of trade would affect economic activity and inflation in Canada," the summary read.

Bartlett said he expects economic data will open the door to a quarter-point interest rate cut at the Bank of Canada's next decision on Sept. 17.

But that's contingent on core inflation readings getting back under control in the upcoming CPI releases for July and August.

"If we see that there's less passthrough from tariffs into inflation than we're expecting ... we think there there's an opportunity for the Bank of Canada to cut further," he said.

5. Trump's takeover of Washington law enforcement faces anger, pushback and protests

WASHINGTON -- Members of the United States National Guard stood near the Washington Monument on Saturday amid escalating tensions in the U.S. capital as President Donald Trump ramped up the presence of law enforcement in the mostly Democratic city.

Tourists walking by the uniformed troops in Washington's blistering weekend heat were confused about their presence, with a group from Kentucky asking why the troops were even there. Some families requested photos with the troops and the National Guard members obliged.

The sight of army-fatigued National Guard members and face-covered police agents has increased in Washington throughout the week after Trump signed an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the nation's capital.

Many residents of Washington are outraged by Trump's overreach, with scores taking to the streets on Saturday to protest the president's takeover. People held signs that read "Hands off DC" and "Dump Trump" while chanting "Trump must go" as they walked toward the White House.

Autumn Tustin, holding a sign that said "No ICE! No National Guard!" said it was important to show up for the demonstration outside the White House because other people don't feel safe coming out to push against Trump's agenda to take over the capital.

"Being part of a movement feels like the best thing we can do at this point," she told The Canadian Press.

Tustin said sometimes it feels like "frogs in a boiling pot of water," where there are a lot of ongoing changes that have huge consequences down the road.

She has seen several National Guard members in tourist areas, describing it as "bizarre" and a "waste of talent and money."

On Saturday, West Virginia, Ohio and South Carolina authorized hundreds of additional National Guard members to head to Washington.

"West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital," West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said.

Hundreds of federal law enforcement officers from agencies such as the Secret Service and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement have also fanned across the city.

Social media platforms have since filled with videos and pictures of federal agents descending on neighbourhoods -- apprehending delivery drivers, dismantling homeless camps and approaching people on the city's public transportation system and in local parks.

One viral video showed a man hurling a sandwich at a federal law-enforcement official. Following the incident, sandwich-thrower Sean Charles Dunn was fired from his job in the U.S. Justice Department and charged with a felony.

Trump's takeover has caused outrage from Washington residents but there's little city leaders are able to do to stop it. The District of Columbia is uniquely controlled by the federal government and local leaders are obliged to co-operate with Trump's order.

Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, in a letter to residents, said the city's "limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now."

Trump on Monday claimed he had to take the action because crime "is getting worse, not getting better," even as police data shows that violence in the capital city is falling.

Washington has been plagued by violent crime, particularly during drug epidemics of the 1980s and early 1990s. There was a spike in violent crime again in 2023 but it plummeted the following year and has declined again so far in 2025.

Much of the National Guard presence in Washington appears symbolic, with members roasting in the summer heat near national monuments and museums. Other law enforcement agencies, however, have descended throughout the city, evoking anger and fear in many local residents.

There's been a clear increase in police presence in neighbourhoods like the dense and diverse Columbia Heights, and on Friday night in entertainment districts like U Street, 14th Street and 16th Street, north of the White House.

It's less clear how much, if any, policing has increased in areas in the southeast that have higher crime rates.

6. Lawyer 'very confident' a foreign adversary attacked Canadian diplomats in Cuba - Medicine Hat News

OTTAWA -- A lawyer for Canadian diplomats and their families says he believes the mysterious ailments they suffered in Cuba were caused by a foreign adversary, despite a federal government report that dismisses the theory. Eight years after foreign service officials and their dependants began reporting such symptoms as headaches, memory loss, mood changes, vision problems, nausea and nosebleeds, a legal action against Ottawa over the health problems is still grinding along in Federal Court. The 17 plaintiffs, who seek millions of dollars in damages, allege the Canadian government failed to protect them, hid crucial information and downplayed the seriousness of the risks. The government has denied negligence and wrongdoing. Several U.S. personnel who worked in Cuba have reported similar health issues, commonly known as Havana Syndrome. Theories about the cause have included pesticide spraying, the effect of chirping crickets, malfunctioning eavesdropping devices, and targeted energy or sonic attacks by an enemy state. The Canadian government says it has found no evidence of foul play by a foreign adversary. A Global Affairs Canada report completed in August 2024 says the department has concluded that the unexplained health incidents "were not the result of a malicious act of a foreign actor." The report, drawing on the work of an interdepartmental task force and external experts, says pre-existing medical conditions, environmental factors and conventional illnesses "were likely to have been important factors in many of the symptoms experienced." The report adds that the findings "do not cast doubt on the authenticity of the symptoms reported by staff members and their dependants." Paul Miller, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told The Canadian Press he is "very confident" a foreign actor is to blame for the Canadians' health difficulties. "I really trust the people that I have spoken with and met with," he said. "I have absolutely no faith in the (Global Affairs Canada) report because they are trying to put out the narrative that works for them." The plaintiffs' court action, filed in 2019, remains unresolved. Three years ago, the parties agreed to the appointment of a former Supreme Court judge to mediate the claims of nine family members in the case. Miller said the two days of talks in early 2023 "just went nowhere." He said he has made efforts to file new information in the case but the material is being treated as confidential pending the resolution of concerns about the disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information, as defined by the Canada Evidence Act. The Global Affairs report traces the various steps federal agencies have taken over the years in response to the illness complaints, including security, medical and environmental assessments. A multi-agency Integrated National Security Enforcement Team, led by the RCMP, opened an investigation in June 2017. Global Affairs and RCMP officials began travelling regularly to Cuba as part of the investigation to look at the possibility of malicious attacks, the report says. Canadian officials also shared information with foreign partners, including the United States. In 2019, instruments designed to detect and capture evidence of acoustic and radiation surges, and to measure environmental effects -- such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and ozone levels -- were installed in the living quarters of Canadian staff in Havana. "The data collected from the instruments did not provide relevant and probative information to identify a cause for the symptoms," the Global Affairs report says. "As such, in 2022, the instruments were removed." The integrated national security team concluded "there was no criminality and no evidence attributing these health symptoms to a foreign actor," the report adds. "In their conclusions, the RCMP and other domestic partner agencies assess that there is no known criminality, no known attribution for (unexplained health incidents) and no patterns related to symptoms, age, gender, location, or other variable." The U.S. intelligence community looked at possible evidence of a foreign adversary's involvement, the feasibility of tools that could cause the reported symptoms and whether medical analysis could help find answers. A March 1, 2023, report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council said these lines of inquiry led most intelligence community agencies to conclude -- with varying levels of confidence -- that it was "very unlikely" a foreign adversary was responsible for the health issues reported by American personnel. Global Affairs, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the RCMP subsequently met to discuss the U.S. council's findings. The RCMP indicated that "since no criminality was uncovered, its criminal investigation would be concluded," and CSIS advised it also would be wrapping up its investigations for similar reasons, the Global Affairs report says. Overall, the Canadian efforts "have not uncovered a clear common cause of the symptoms experienced by government of Canada employees," the report adds. "Canada's findings are aligned with the conclusions of the United States on their various health studies and the security report published by the National Intelligence Council." Miller points to other research and testimony that challenge those findings. Lawyer Mark Zaid, representing several U.S. personnel with symptoms, told a congressional hearing in May 2024 there was intelligence, scientific and medical evidence substantiating the reports of anomalous health incidents, and that some were caused by a foreign adversary. Zaid, who had authorized access to secret details, said he was convinced that "the evidence that exists in the classified arena directly contradicts the public conclusions" provided by U.S. federal agencies about the cause of the health symptoms. Global Affairs says it stands by the findings of its 2024 report. Department spokesperson John Babcock said the foreign ministry continues to support the Canadian diplomats and their dependants. "For privacy and security reasons, Global Affairs Canada cannot comment on the specifics of the ongoing investigations, individual cases, nor on specific security measures," he said in an emailed response to questions. "We cannot provide further comment on this matter as it is before the courts." Internal Global Affairs notes -- prepared last year to help answer questions about the department's report -- say the unexplained health incidents "highlighted the challenges of providing responsive health care to diplomats and their families in the context of unforeseen crisis situations abroad." The notes, obtained through the Access to Information Act, say the department had initiated a "thorough review" of the department's overseas health program for employees and their dependants in missions around the world.

7. Trump's takeover of Washington law enforcement faces anger, pushback and protests - Medicine Hat News

WASHINGTON -- Members of the United States National Guard stood near the Washington Monument on Saturday amid escalating tensions in the U.S. capital as President Donald Trump ramped up the presence of law enforcement in the mostly Democratic city. Tourists walking by the uniformed troops in Washington's blistering weekend heat were confused about their presence, with a group from Kentucky asking why the troops were even there. Some families requested photos with the troops and the National Guard members obliged. The sight of army-fatigued National Guard members and face-covered police agents has increased in Washington throughout the week after Trump signed an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the nation's capital. Many residents of Washington are outraged by Trump's overreach, with scores taking to the streets on Saturday to protest the president's takeover. People held signs that read "Hands off DC" and "Dump Trump" while chanting "Trump must go" as they walked toward the White House. Autumn Tustin, holding a sign that said "No ICE! No National Guard!" said it was important to show up for the demonstration outside the White House because other people don't feel safe coming out to push against Trump's agenda to take over the capital. "Being part of a movement feels like the best thing we can do at this point," she told The Canadian Press. Tustin said sometimes it feels like "frogs in a boiling pot of water," where there are a lot of ongoing changes that have huge consequences down the road. She has seen several National Guard members in tourist areas, describing it as "bizarre" and a "waste of talent and money." On Saturday, West Virginia, Ohio and South Carolina authorized hundreds of additional National Guard members to head to Washington. "West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital," West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said. Hundreds of federal law enforcement officers from agencies such as the Secret Service and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement have also fanned across the city. Social media platforms have since filled with videos and pictures of federal agents descending on neighbourhoods -- apprehending delivery drivers, dismantling homeless camps and approaching people on the city's public transportation system and in local parks. One viral video showed a man hurling a sandwich at a federal law-enforcement official. Following the incident, sandwich-thrower Sean Charles Dunn was fired from his job in the U.S. Justice Department and charged with a felony. Trump's takeover has caused outrage from Washington residents but there's little city leaders are able to do to stop it. The District of Columbia is uniquely controlled by the federal government and local leaders are obliged to co-operate with Trump's order. Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, in a letter to residents, said the city's "limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now." Trump on Monday claimed he had to take the action because crime "is getting worse, not getting better," even as police data shows that violence in the capital city is falling. Washington has been plagued by violent crime, particularly during drug epidemics of the 1980s and early 1990s. There was a spike in violent crime again in 2023 but it plummeted the following year and has declined again so far in 2025. Much of the National Guard presence in Washington appears symbolic, with members roasting in the summer heat near national monuments and museums. Other law enforcement agencies, however, have descended throughout the city, evoking anger and fear in many local residents. There's been a clear increase in police presence in neighbourhoods like the dense and diverse Columbia Heights, and on Friday night in entertainment districts like U Street, 14th Street and 16th Street, north of the White House. It's less clear how much, if any, policing has increased in areas in the southeast that have higher crime rates. Trump was at his Virginia golf club Saturday. -- With files from The Associated Press This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 16, 2025. Kelly Geraldine Malone, The Canadian Press


8. Apple Watch blood oxygen feature returns: Stunning update rolls out with iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1. How can you access it?

Apple will introduce a redesigned Blood Oxygen feature for some Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users through an iPhone and Apple Watch software update, the tech giant said on Thursday. The feature typically allows users to see a readout of their blood oxygen level right on the Apple Watch.

Tech giant Apple is bringing blood oxygen detection back to its latest smartwatches after the company was forced to stop offering the feature on US models over a patent dispute. The blood oxygen feature will come to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Ultra 2 models in the US currently missing the functionality through a software update, the company said in a statement. This feature is meant to help people understand their respiratory health.

Apple is rolling out a software update that enables a redesigned version of the feature for the Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 that circumvents the import ban imposed by the International Trade Commission. To get around the ban, blood oxygen data collected on the Apple Watch will now be measured and calculated on the iPhone that it is paired to. While users won't be able to view the data on their wrist, they'll be able to view it in the iPhone's Health app under the Respiratory section.

iOS 18.6.1 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update. watchOS 11.6.1 is available for newer Apple Watch models that have blood oxygen monitoring disabled, and it can be downloaded through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone.

This marks the latest development in a years-long saga that saw Apple temporarily yank its popular smartwatches from US store shelves during the critical holiday season nearly two years ago. In 2023, the International Trade Commission ruled that Apple had violated a patent from digital health company Masimo related to its pulse oximeter technology, which Apple denied strongly.

When the order was issued, it applied only to new Apple Watches in the United States, meaning those who already owned an Apple Watch with the feature were unaffected. Apple Watches sold outside the United States were also unaffected by the order.

Now, Apple has found a workaround and is restoring it through the new iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 updates. Apple's decision to release the update follows a fresh US Customs ruling that allows the company to import watches with a redesigned version of the technology.

Users with models Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the US who currently do not have the Blood Oxygen feature will have access to the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature by updating their paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and their Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1.

Following this update, sensor data from the Blood Oxygen app on Apple Watch will be measured and calculated on the paired iPhone, and results can be viewed in the Respiratory section of the Health app, the company said. This update was enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling.

There will be no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch units purchased outside of the U.S.

In the US, users of these Apple Watch models who don't currently have the Blood Oxygen feature can get the redesigned version by updating their iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1.

With the latest update, the Blood Oxygen app on Apple Watch now sends its data to the paired iPhone for processing. The results will be displayed in the Health app under the Respiratory section. This change comes in response to a US Customs ruling. In simple terms, Apple Watch users in the US can once again measure their blood oxygen levels directly on their watch, but the detailed results will only appear on the iPhone. Watches that were sold with the original feature, or those purchased outside the US, remain unaffected.


9. How Crypto Diplomacy Boosts Pakistan's Importance in Washington?

*Web Desk:* According to the British newspaper *Financial Times*, Pakistan's recent crypto initiatives have significantly increased its importance in Washington and opened new avenues for investment.

The report highlights that the strategic vision of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, combined with crypto-driven measures, has earned Pakistan recognition in U.S. policy circles. The Asia Pacific Foundation noted that relations between the United States and Pakistan have witnessed an unexpected improvement and reached a new high.

*Financial Times* revealed that ties between the Trump administration and Islamabad are warming, while India has expressed dissatisfaction over the development. Through what analysts describe as "crypto diplomacy," Pakistan has managed to secure space within Trump's business inner circles.

In a major breakthrough, World Liberty Financial signed a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council. This agreement sets the stage for the tokenization of Pakistan's vast mineral resources, estimated to be worth trillions of dollars.

Bilal Bin Saqib, Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, participated in key trade negotiations in Washington, where Pakistan's crypto potential was effectively showcased before Trump's close associates and U.S. advisors.

The reception in Washington has been positive, with American officials and business leaders showing strong interest in Pakistan's crypto projects. Analysts believe this could pave the way for significant foreign investment in the country.


10. MMJ International Holdings: President Trump's Marijuana Fix? DEA's Program Exposed: Promises Made, Promises Not Kept

"As President Trump weighs marijuana rescheduling in the coming weeks, the DEA's track record reveals years of mismanagement, empty promises, and patients left waiting," stated MMJ CEO Duane Boise.

WASHINGTON, D.C. / ACCESS Newswire / August 17, 2025 / President Trump's decision to potentially reschedule marijuana is the first serious step in decades to break through the bureaucratic logjam that has kept patients and scientists waiting. For years, the DEA has promised a functional marijuana research program. For years, those promises have been broken.

DEA's Promises on Paper

In its Final Rule (85 Fed. Reg. 82333, Dec. 18, 2020), the DEA pledged that marijuana manufacturing licenses would be tied to FDA science and genuine medical research. The agency declared:

"DEA will evaluate each application... to determine whether the applicant's proposed activities... will promote medical research."

"DEA will require applicants to demonstrate bona fide supply agreements with researchers authorized by the FDA to conduct clinical research."

"DEA's goal is to ensure that the United States has a sufficient supply of marihuana to meet the legitimate medical, scientific, and research needs of the United States."

These were the promises.

The Harsh Reality

But DEA's actions told a different story:

Licenses granted to companies with no FDA INDs, no clinical trial protocols, and no scientific foundation.

No bona fide supply agreements with FDA-authorized researchers - a direct violation of DEA's own Final Rule.

Four years later, there is still no adequate, federally compliant supply of cannabis for clinical trials, leaving patients with Huntington's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and other conditions waiting.

The only company that meets DEA's own published criteria - MMJ BioPharma, with two FDA-filed INDs and an Orphan Drug Designation - has been stalled while non-scientific registrants received licenses.

Promises Made, Promises Not Kept

DEA's marijuana program has been a case study in mismanagement:

Rules written, then ignored.

Patients promised access, then denied it.

Science promised priority, then sidelined.

President Trump's possible rescheduling decision shines a spotlight on this failure. By moving marijuana to Schedule III, he has forced the issue back into the open and made clear that real reform will require DEA accountability.

The Path Forward

Patients deserve more than empty promises. They deserve consistent, reproducible, FDA-approved medicines. They deserve agencies that follow their own rules. And they deserve leadership that keeps its word.

With rescheduling now on the table, it is time to hold DEA to account for the gap between its promises and its performance. President Trump has taken the first step - now the DEA must be compelled to deliver.

1. [Finlight] Syria‚Äôs al-Sharaa calls for unity, accuses Israel of fuelling unrest in south

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks during a joint press conference with French President after a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on May 7, 2025.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has said the battle to unify his country after years of civil war "should not be with blood", rejecting any partition and accusing Israel of meddling in the south.

His remarks, released by state TV on Sunday, came as hundreds demonstrated in south Syria's Sweida province, denouncing sectarian violence last month and calling for the right to self-determination for the Druze-majority province.

"We still have another battle ahead of us to unify Syria, and it should not be with blood and military force... it should be through some kind of understanding because Syria is tired of war," Sharaa said during a dialogue session involving notables from the northwest province of Idlib and other senior officials.

"I do not see Syria as at risk of division. Some people desire a process of dividing Syria and trying to establish cantons... this matter is impossible," he said according to a recording of the meeting, distributed overnight by state media.

"Some parties seek to gain power through regional power, Israel or others. This is also extremely difficult and cannot be implemented," he said.

At the protest in Sweida, some demonstrators waved the Israeli flag and called for self-determination for the region.

A week of bloodshed in Sweida began on July 13 with clashes between Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin, but rapidly escalated, drawing in government forces, with Israel also carrying out strikes.

Syrian authorities have said their forces intervened to stop the clashes, but witnesses, Druze factions and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have accused them of siding with the Bedouin and committing abuses against the Druze, including summary executions.

Sharaa said that Sweida "witnessed many violations from all sides... some members of the security forces and army in Syria also carried out some violations".

The state is required "to hold all perpetrators of violations to account", whatever their affiliation, he added.

"Israel is intervening directly in Sweida, seeking to implement policies aimed at weakening the state in general or finding excuses to interfere in ongoing policies in the southern region," Sharaa said.

Israel, which has its own Druze community, has said it has acted to defend the minority group as well as enforce its demands for the demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Syria's new authorities are also in talks with a semi-autonomous Kurdish administration that runs swathes of the country's north and northeast and has called for decentralisation, which Damascus has rejected.

Implementation of a March 10 deal on integrating the Kurds' semi-autonomous civil and military institutions into the state has been held up by differences between the parties.

"We are now discussing the mechanisms for implementation" of the deal, Sharaa said.

2. [Finlight] Rayner says Farage ‚Äòfailing young women‚Äô with plan to scrap Online Safety Act

Nigel Farage is ‚Äúfailing a generation of young women‚Äù with his plans to scrap the Online Safety Act, Angela Rayner has said, arguing the move would cause an increase in the prevalence of ‚Äúrevenge porn‚Äù.

The comments by the deputy prime minister are the latest criticism of Farage from the government, with Labour launching a parallel series of attack adverts on the Reform UK leader, including one showing him alongside the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate.

In a press conference at the end of last month, Reform promised to scrap the act, which had just come into force, saying measures intended to push social media companies to limit false and potentially harmful content would instead bring censorship and make the UK ‚Äúa borderline dystopian state‚Äù.

In response, the science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, accused Farage of being on the side of child abusers such as Jimmy Savile, bringing a furious response from the Reform leader.

In comments to the Sunday Telegraph, Rayner highlighted what she said would be the risks of getting rid of the act in terms of clamping down on what is formally known as intimate image abuse, where offenders either upload intimate pictures or footage of others or else share them via other means.

‚ÄúIntimate image abuse is a devastating crime and contributes to a vile misogynistic culture on social media that we know translates into physical spaces too,‚Äù Rayner told the paper.

‚ÄúNigel Farage risks failing a generation of young women with his dangerous and irresponsible plans to scrap online safety laws. Scrapping safeguards and having no viable alternative plan in place to halt the floodgates of abuse that could open is an appalling dereliction of duty.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Farage to tell women and girls across Britain how he would keep them safe online.‚Äù

Labour is launching a linked series of online adverts against Farage, including one published on Sunday morning connected to Rayner‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúNigel Farage wants to make it easier to share revenge porn online,‚Äù it says, alongside an image of Farage grinning.

According to the Sunday Times, another advert will highlight Farage‚Äôs comments about Tate, the influencer who, along with his brother, Tristan, faces charges in the UK including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.

The two British Americans are under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges that they deny.

The Labour advert shows Farage with Andrew Tate and the headline: ‚ÄúNigel Farage says Andrew Tate is an ‚Äòimportant voice‚Äô for men.‚Äù The comments come from an interview Farage did on the Strike It Big podcast last year.

Laila Cunningham, a former magistrate who has joined Reform, wrote a Telegraph article on Saturday in which she called the Online Safety Act ‚Äúcensorship laws‚Äù, saying laws already existed to combat ‚Äùrevenge porn‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cover for censorship, and an excuse to hand unelected regulators sweeping powers to silence views they don‚Äôt like, while doing nothing about the real crimes happening on our streets,‚Äù she wrote.

Cunningham said minister should instead focus on detaining asylum seekers rather than putting them in hotels, saying that for now, women ‚Äúare being put in harm‚Äôs way‚Äù as the asylum seekers could pose a risk to them.

4. [Finlight] Will Trump‚Äôs tariffs get ‚Äôtariffried‚Äô by the courts?

Investing.com --¬†The Trump administration is bracing for a potential legal setback that could undermine its tariff strategy, analysts at Yardeni Research highlighted in a note this week.¬†
The firm stated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., may soon rule that President Donald Trump lacks the legal authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
Yardeni noted that concern was evident in an August 11 letter from two of the administration‚Äôs top lawyers to the court clerk, filed after oral arguments on July 31, where judges reportedly pressed the government on the tariffs‚Äô legality.¬†
The letter warns that ‚Äúsuddenly revoking the President‚Äôs tariff authority under IEEPA would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,‚Äù adding it could ‚Äúlead to a 1929-style result.‚Äù
While Yardeni said the conclusion ‚Äúmay be exaggerated,‚Äù the fallout would still be ‚Äúmessy,‚Äù with foreign governments potentially ignoring trade agreements and companies seeking tariff refunds from the Treasury.
Trump has promoted tariffs as an ‚ÄúExternal Revenue Service‚Äù to help cut the federal deficit.¬†
Customs duties hit a record $157 billion over the 12 months through July, and Trump has aimed for a base tariff of 10%-15% on all U.S. trading partners, potentially yielding over $500 billion annually.
Losing the case could raise bond yields and pressure stocks due to renewed policy uncertainty, according to Yardeni.
The firm cited Capital Alpha Partners‚Äô Jim Lucier, who expects a Federal Circuit decision by late August or September.
¬†A unanimous ruling against the administration could give the Supreme Court cover to avoid the case and decline a stay that would keep the tariffs in place.


5. [Finlight] Wells Fargo outlines how the Fed may revisit its policy framework at Jackson Hole

Investing.com -¬†Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to go over how the U.S. economy and the central bank‚Äôs policy setting has evolved over the course of his tenure at a closely-watched event in Wyoming later this month, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.
Powell previously used his address at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in 2020 to lay out changes to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs policy framework. Some five years later, that outline is now set to reach its conclusion.
In a note, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Sarah House noted that in the decade leading up to the FOMC‚Äôs prior framework review, the economic environment was dominated by persistently low inflation and excess labor market slack. The Fed has been tasked with using its policies options to keep inflation stable and securing maximum employment.¬†
"The adjustments made in 2020 at the height of the pandemic reflected these perceived asymmetric risks to the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate," the analysts wrote.
However, in the time since then, the macroeconomic backdrop has changed drastically. Powered by pandemic-era shocks, inflation charged past 2% in March 2021 and has not returned to that rate -- the Fed‚Äôs target level -- since. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to less than 4% by the end of that same year. It now stands at 4.2%.
"Much of the past few years have been marked by U.S. monetary policymakers facing an old but new problem: overheated labor markets and above-target inflation," the analysts wrote.
Against this backdrop, they do not anticipate that the Fed will unveil any major changes to its toolkit as part of this year‚Äôs review, with the key federal funds rate likely to stay the main device the central bank can utilize to respond to broader trends in employment and inflation.
The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet may also be "de-emphasized" as a policy tool "for the time being," they added. Powell is anticipated to review how the FOMC approaches policy communication later this year as well.
Generally, the strategists said the new framework will likely "codify" what is already the Fed‚Äôs "modus operandi" -- a more "symmetric" approach to its inflation and employment objectives.
"Yet, the shift away from the asymmetric risks around low inflation and maximum employment marks an important departure from the psychology of the 2008-2020 period, and it could result in more preemptive policy tightening when the next inflationary episode occurs," they said.

7. [Finlight] UAE: What are Certificates of Origin and how Abu Dhabi‚Äôs 10.3% rise proves a shift from oil dependence

Certificates of Origin certify that goods are produced in a specific country, essential for customs, tariffs, and export compliance/ Image: File

Certificates of Origin: Their role and relevance

Growth in COO issuance reflects rising export momentum





Strategic implications for Abu Dhabi‚Äôs economy

Institutional role of the Abu Dhabi Chamber





The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported a significant increase in the issuance of Certificates of Origin over the past year. This development highlights the emirate‚Äôs growing industrial base, increased trade activity, and a steadily advancing economic diversification strategy aimed at reducing dependence on oil exports.A Certificate of Origin (COO) serves as an official document confirming that the goods in a shipment are wholly obtained, produced, manufactured, or processed in a specific country. These certificates are vital tools in international trade, helping businesses clear customs, determine applicable tariffs, and comply with import regulations in target markets.In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, a valid COO is often mandatory for both exports and imports. Without it, companies risk facing shipment delays, regulatory penalties, or outright rejection of goods. In this context, chambers of commerce, such as the one in Abu Dhabi, play a central role, acting as accredited bodies authorised to issue these certificates.Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Abu Dhabi Chamber recorded a 10.3 percent increase in the number of COOs issued. This growth signals a wider and more active base of local exporters, as well as heightened economic activity across non-oil sectors.The Chamber attributes this uptick to Abu Dhabi‚Äôs expanding industrial capacity and its growing reputation as a key regional player in trade and investment.Sectorally, the bulk of these COOs were issued to businesses involved in chemicals, metals, and engineering ‚Äî all areas that point to a robust and diversified manufacturing ecosystem. Notably, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have shown increased participation in export activities, driven by support mechanisms provided by the Chamber. These include specialised training programs, business matchmaking efforts, and collaboration with regional and international trade entities.The broader export landscape also aligns with these trends. During the first half of 2025, Abu Dhabi‚Äôs non-oil foreign trade surged by 34.7 percent. Within that, non-oil exports leapt by 64 percent, re-exports grew by 35 percent, and imports rose by 15 percent. These figures build on the previous year‚Äôs performance, which also saw strong growth: non-oil trade rose by 9 percent, exports increased by 16 percent, and imports by 3 percent.The increasing number of Certificates of Origin being issued by the Abu Dhabi Chamber is seen by its leadership as a strong indicator of export sector vitality and a reflection of the emirate‚Äôs deepening integration with global trade networks. Shamis Al Dhaheri, Second Vice Chairman and Managing Director of the Chamber, considers this sustained rise as clear proof of the competitiveness of Abu Dhabi-based companies and their growing capacity to enter and thrive in international markets.Al Dhaheri has attributed this momentum not only to market confidence in locally produced goods but also to the Chamber‚Äôs continued investment in supporting export-ready businesses. He noted that Abu Dhabi companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, are increasingly leveraging the Chamber‚Äôs services, including export training, market access programs, and strategic trade partnerships, to expand their global footprint.He also emphasized that the Chamber is focused on enabling exporters to benefit from customs advantages provided by bilateral and multilateral agreements. With COOs validating the national origin of goods, UAE products are better positioned to benefit from preferential trade terms, giving them a more competitive edge in international markets.According to him, the Chamber views Certificates of Origin as more than just administrative tools; they are gateways to new economic opportunities. He pointed to the Chamber‚Äôs ongoing efforts to enhance its digital infrastructure and to advocate for the private sector as part of a broader strategy to make Abu Dhabi‚Äôs economy more resilient and globally connected.Al Dhaheri underlined that the current indicators affirm not just the strength of the Chamber‚Äôs services, but also the private sector‚Äôs rising contribution to national economic goals. The increase in export activity, particularly among SMEs, is seen as a tangible outcome of the emirate‚Äôs diversification agenda and its efforts to reduce dependency on oil revenues.Founded in 1969 by an Emiri decree issued by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established to promote and protect the interests of businesses operating in the emirate. Over the decades, it has evolved into a central platform for dialogue between the private sector and the government, supporting enterprise development across sectors.The Chamber hosts frequent trade delegations, policy discussions, and cross-border business forums. These activities help reinforce Abu Dhabi‚Äôs global standing and attract foreign direct investment.

1. Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems - SiliconANGLE

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.

It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world."

China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce.

Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.


8. China's AI tech boosts global trade efficiency, facilitates supply chain

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q&A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing.

"Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

During discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade.

Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model.

"The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes.

At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms.

The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for overseas market.

Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba.

As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.
