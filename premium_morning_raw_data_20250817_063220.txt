1. Assam: Two elephants electrocuted to death in Baksa district

Guwahati: A female elephant was electrocuted to death in Shantipur in Assam's Baksa district. Wildlife conservationist Kangkana Manu Sarma shared the news on her social media, revealing that another elephant also died the same day from electrocution.

The female elephant was pregnant, which made the loss even more painful.

The deaths have sparked growing concern among wildlife activists and local communities, as similar incidents have been happening in the area for years. Sarma pointed out that this is not an isolated case.

In 2018, an elephant was electrocuted while searching for food in Kalipur. In 2020, another elephant died near Gaibari, close to the India-Bhutan border. In 2021, two female elephants were electrocuted near Gola Gaon. Earlier this year, a young elephant also died after touching an electrified wire in Dihira Reserved Forest.

Experts explain that elephants often leave forests and enter nearby villages or farmland in search of food. Farmers, especially near the India-Bhutan border, use electric fences connected to household power lines to protect their crops. These fences, meant to keep crops safe, pose a deadly threat to elephants and other wildlife.

Baksa district has several protected forests, including Manas National Park and Dihira Reserved Forest. However, the area struggles with a shortage of forest guards and limited resources for patrolling. The lack of communication between forest authorities and local communities makes it harder to raise awareness about the dangers of electric fences.

Wildlife activists are urging the forest department to take action. They suggest educating local people about the dangers of electric fences and enforcing strict rules against illegal fences. Experts also recommend using solar-powered fences, which are safer because they use less power.

In addition to awareness campaigns, wildlife experts stress the need for regular checks on villages near protected areas. They believe it's important to remove illegal electric fences and hold those responsible accountable to prevent further deaths.

Sarma, in her social media post, urged the forest department to take quick action. She wrote, "Awareness and precautions are crucial. Only then can we stop these tragic deaths and help humans and elephants live together peacefully."

The repeated deaths of elephants in the Baksa district highlight the ongoing conflict between wildlife and human activities in Assam. Immediate action is needed to protect both wildlife and the livelihoods of local people.


2. Russia has no intention of ending war despite Trump's push for peace

GENEVA - The European Union (EU) foreign policy chief on Saturday said US President Donald Trump's determination to secure a peace deal is "vital" but warned that Russia has "no intention of ending" the war in Ukraine.

"President Trump's resolve to get a peace deal is vital," Kaja Kallas said in a post on US social media platform X. "The EU and our European partners worked to coordinate with President Trump ahead of (the) Alaska meeting. But the harsh reality is that Russia has no intention of ending this war anytime soon."

Kallas said Moscow escalated attacks even as delegations gathered.

"(Russian President Vladimir) Putin continues to drag out negotiations and hopes he gets away with it. He left Anchorage without making any commitments to end the killing," she said.

"The U.S. holds the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously," she said. "The EU will work with Ukraine and the U.S. so that Russia's aggression does not succeed and that any peace is sustainable."

The EU foreign policy chief reaffirmed Europe's resolve to back Kyiv.

"Moscow won't end the war until it realises it can't continue. So Europe will continue to back Ukraine, including by working on a 19th Russia sanctions package," she said.

Kallas said European security is "not up for negotiation."

"The real root cause of the war is Russia's imperialist foreign policy, not an imaginary imbalance in the European security architecture," she said.

Trump and Putin were upbeat after their more than three-hour closed-door talks, with the Russian leader saying they had come to reach an "understanding."

After the meeting, Trump said it is now up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders "to get it done."

"A lot of points were agreed on, there's not that much, you know, one or two pretty significant items, but I think they can be reached," Trump said during a Fox News interview following his historic sit-down with Putin in Alaska.

"Now, it's really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done. And I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit, but it's up to President Zelenskyy," he added. (Anadolu)


3. Fair rivalry please: India's antitrust watchdog needs to get its mojo back

In 2012, Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital in Mumbai denied a couple, Manu Jain and Saurabh Kumar, the right to choose their preferred stem cell banker. The couple did not turn to the judiciary or even a consumer court for justice. Instead, they approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI). About a year later, India's fair-trade regulator fined the hospital ‚Çπ3.8 crore for anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices.

The CCI, established in 2009 to rein in the misuse of market power by powerful companies and protect consumer interests, was then the new sheriff in town. Consumers and companies could seek speedy justice against any abuse of dominance by enterprises or exploitation by competitors. The CCI has since then busted cartels across a raft of sectors ranging from entertainment to cement. It has raided companies suspected of foul play. Any merger and acquisition (M&A) worth its salt needs the CCI's approval.

Also Read: Competition: We must raise the CCI's tooth-to-tail ratio

That's not all. The CCI seems to have the government's backing. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has in the past coddled the regulator to police American Big Tech companies and asked it to stay "proactively alert" to ensure healthy competition.

Yet, the CCI is now a fading star in India's regulatory constellation, hobbled by loads of important pending cases. Take a look:

A probe was launched in January 2020 against e-commerce companies to examine allegations of preferential treatment of certain sellers and deep discounting practices that could be predatory. More than five years later, the case seems to be going nowhere.

In April 2022, food delivery firms Zomato and Swiggy came under the CCI's scrutiny for exclusivity clauses and platform neutrality issues. A final order is pending.

The CCI had opened multiple cases against tech giant Google. An investigation of its Android licensing practices, Play Store billing system and Android TV dominance is more than four years old. The CCI settled the Android TV case in April 2025, but the wider inquiry into advertising practices and Play Store service charges is unresolved.

Although an investigation against Apple was completed in July last year, the CCI is yet to issue a final ruling. The complaint dates back to 2021.

Also Read: Google's settlement with CCI over Android TVs: A win-win?

An investigation into quick commerce companies such as Blinkit, Instamart and Zepto, which potentially impacts scores of mom-and-pop stores across the country, is moving at a snail's pace. Last December, the CCI raided the premises of alcohol companies Pernod Ricard and AB InBev to investigate complaints of price collusion in Telangana. Again, that case is hanging. What about its probes into steel and cement companies that face charges of violating antitrust rules? Same story.

It is not hard to see why rulings on high-profile cases are delayed. The CCI has long been operating with a severe staff shortage. For example, the director general's office, which is tasked with fact-finding as part of CCI investigations, is understaffed. Only 113 of the CCI's 195 sanctioned posts were filled as of 31 March 2024, "indicating a significant vacancy rate," as observed by a parliamentary panel that reviews financial matters of the government in a report published on 11 August.

Also Read: There's no arguing with the broad thrust of CCI's order on WhatsApp's use of data

The CCI still has a knack for making news, no doubt. Its crackdowns against Asian Paints and the advertising industry are recent examples of the flutter it can cause.

But what about a final closure in critical cases? That is anybody's guess.

Not all delays are the CCI's fault. The regulator faces the same challenge that many in India seeking justice are up against -- a plodding judiciary. The Delhi and Karnataka high courts, for example, have stayed multiple CCI investigations, including the case against Flipkart and Amazon.

Granted, antitrust investigations can be time-consuming, but the pile-up of delayed cases is worrying. The CCI website shows that it has a disposal rate of 90% for antitrust cases. But its record on significant cases, especially those that affect consumers, is poor. In 2022, the CCI launched an inquiry against hospitals, promising to crack down on inflated prices of medicines and medical devices. That case is also gathering dust.

Not long ago, CCI prioritized the susceptibility of public tenders to anti-competitive practices. Not anymore. Can an institution saddled with existing cases be expected to pursue new ones with due rigour?

Also Read: Why CCI matters for protecting customers from digital players

Delays weaken the regulation of business practices, which hurts consumers and new players by failing to check the ill effects of cartelization and market dominance in many fields. This, at a time when fair-trade regulators globally are trying to keep pace with speedy changes in tech industries like AI.

India's government should fast-track the appointment of CCI officers. Legislative reforms are also needed. The CCI must be empowered to issue interim orders or launch market studies that have statutory backing. The settlement mechanism used in the Google Android TV case this April could be broadly adopted to speed up enforcement. The CCI must resolve critical and time-sensitive cases speedily.

India's competition regulator has a vital role in ensuring markets remain fair, transparent and competitive. But in the absence of systemic reforms, institutional capacity and judicial support, it risks becoming a toothless watchdog -- slow to act, easy to bypass and at risk of irrelevance.

With India's economy growing fast and new-age monopolies emerging, the case for empowering the CCI and holding it accountable has never been stronger.

4. AP News in Brief at 6:04 a.m. EDT

Trump reverses on the need for a ceasefire before a potential peace deal ending the war in Ukraine

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- U.S. President Donald Trump reversed course in the wake of his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to say an overall peace agreement -- not the ceasefire that he has long championed -- is the next step in ending the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine.

In talks with European allies after Friday's summit in Alaska, Trump said Putin reiterated that he wants the key Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up the Donbas. But Putin appeared open to the possibility of halting the stalemate in two other regions, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, with a freeze along the front lines.

That is according to European officials familiar with the calls who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks at a U.S. military base between the American and Russian presidents. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected giving up the territory in the Donbas.

The aftermath of the summit offered little clarity about the next steps, other than Trump's commitment for more meetings, including with Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. It was unclear among those briefed on the exchanges whether Trump saw Putin's desire for the Donbas as acceptable, with Trump's blunt but elliptical way of speaking only adding to a sense of confusion.

The White House had yet to provide a public summary of the calls as Trump golfed on Saturday with his special envoy Steve Witkoff and Fox News anchor Bret Baier at his Virginia golf club. The most transparent takeaway was Trump's abrupt reversal on a ceasefire, raising questions of how peace talks can proceed if attacks continue.

Summit puts Putin back on the global stage and Trump echoes a Kremlin position

In Alaska, President Vladimir Putin walked on a red carpet, shook hands and exchanged smiles with his American counterpart. Donald Trump ended the summit praising their relationship and calling Russia "a big power ... No. 2 in the world," albeit admitting they didn't reach a deal on ending the war in Ukraine.

By Saturday morning Moscow time, Trump appeared to have abandoned the idea of a ceasefire as a step toward peace -- something he and Ukraine had pushed for months -- in favor of pursuing a full-fledged "Peace Agreement" to end the war, echoing a long-held Kremlin position. The "severe consequences" he threatened against Moscow for continuing hostilities were nowhere in sight. On Ukraine's battlefields, Russian troops slowly grinded on, with time on their side.

The hastily arranged Alaska summit "produced nothing for Mr. Trump and gave Mr. Putin most of what he was looking for," said Laurie Bristow, a former British ambassador to Russia.

Putin's visit to Alaska was his first to the United States in 10 years and his first to a Western country since invading Ukraine in 2022 and plunging U.S.-Russia relations to the lowest point since the Cold War. Crippling sanctions followed, along with efforts to shun Russia on the global stage.

The International Criminal Court in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin on accusations of war crimes, casting a shadow on his foreign trips and contacts with other world leaders.

Category 4 Hurricane Erin buffets northern Caribbean islands but not forecast to hit land

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Hurricane Erin exploded in strength and became a major storm in Atlantic waters just north of the Caribbean on Saturday, rapidly powering up from a tropical storm in a single day and bringing heavy rains and high winds to islands in the region.

The first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, Erin reached Category 5 status before weakening somewhat and becoming a Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Late Saturday night, the center reported that Erin was "undergoing structural changes" but was still "formidable" as its rain and winds buffeted Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

The storm's center was about 145 miles (230 kilometers) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and it was heading toward the west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph). It was not forecast to make a direct hit on land.

Hurricane center director Mike Brennen said Erin grew into a "very powerful hurricane," with its winds gaining 60 mph (96 kph) in about nine hours.

Three Republican-led states to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.

West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days, marking a significant escalation of the federal intervention.

The moves came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members.

By adding outside troops to the existing D.C. Guard deployment and federal law enforcement presence, Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.

National Guard members have played a limited role in the federal intervention so far, and it's unclear why additional troops are needed. They have been patrolling at landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station and assisting law enforcement with tasks including crowd control.

Israel prepares to move Palestinians to southern Gaza as Israelis urge mass protest over war

NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) -- Israel announced Saturday that it is preparing to move Palestinians from combat zones to southern Gaza as plans move ahead for a military offensive in some of the territory's most populated areas.

The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said the supply of tents to the territory would resume on Sunday. The military said it had no comment on when the mass movement of Palestinians would begin, but Defense Minister Israel Katz said on social media that "we are now in the stage of discussions to finalize the plan to defeat Hamas in Gaza."

Meanwhile, anxious families of Israeli hostages called for a "nationwide day of stoppage" in Israel on Sunday to express growing frustration over 22 months of war.

Families of hostages fear the coming offensive further endangers the 50 hostages remaining in Gaza, just 20 of them thought to still be alive. They and other Israelis were horrified by the recent release of videos showing emaciated hostages speaking under duress and pleading for help and food.

The families and supporters have pressed the government for a deal to stop the war -- a call that some former Israeli army and intelligence chiefs have made as well in recent weeks.

Pakistan's monsoon flooding death toll rises to 220 as forecasters warn of more rain to come

BUNER, Pakistan (AP) -- Flooding in a northwest Pakistani district has killed at least 220 people, officials said Saturday, as rescuers pulled 63 more bodies overnight from homes flattened by flash floods and landslides, with forecasts of more rain in the coming days.

One eyewitness, who escaped the deluges in Buner, described seeing floodwaters carrying hundreds of boulders and "tons of rocks" crashing down.

Hundreds of rescue workers are still searching for survivors in Buner, one of several places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where torrential rains and cloudbursts caused massive flooding on Friday, said Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for the emergency services. Dozens of homes were swept away.

First responders have been trying to recover bodies from the worst-hit villages of Pir Baba and Malik Pura, where most of the fatalities were, said Kashif Qayyum, a deputy commissioner in Buner.

Local police officer Imtiaz Khan, who narrowly escaped the deluges, said floodwaters carrying hundreds of boulders struck and flattened homes within minutes.

Things to know about the indictment against the New Orleans mayor

NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.

Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as "personal and intimate."

The first female mayor in New Orleans' 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Vappie was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case.

The City of New Orleans said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment and that the mayor's attorney was reviewing it.

Cantrell hasn't sent out a message on her official social media feed on X since July 15, when she said the city was experiencing historic declines in crime. She and her remaining allies have said that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials.

Thomas Edison and Henry Ford among the original snowbirds: The rich going to Florida for the winters

FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Thomas Edison and Henry Ford are famous for their innovations in electricity generation and automobiles respectively, but they were also at the forefront of a massively popular trend in Florida: Rich people from up north spending the cold winter months in the Sunshine State.

Edison first visited Fort Myers in 1885 after a doctor suggested spending time in Florida's warmer climate for health reasons, and he built a house along the Caloosahatchee River the next year. Ford made many visits to southwest Florida to see Edison and purchased the property next door in 1916.

Southwest Florida became their vacation spot, Edison and Ford Winter Estates marketing director Lisa Wilson said. Edison spent most of the year in New Jersey, while Ford lived in Michigan.

"They came down here to escape the cold like many snowbirds do today. But they worked when they were here, so it wasn't just vacation time," Wilson said.

Fort Myers was basically a group of farmers living in an abandoned military fort, using tallow lamps for light, when Edison first visited, Edison and Ford Winter Estates historian Isaac Hunter said.

100 days of Pope Leo XIV: A calm papacy that avoids polemics is coming into focus

VATICAN CITY (AP) -- When Pope Leo XIV surprised tens of thousands of young people at a recent Holy Year celebration with an impromptu popemobile romp around St. Peter's Square, it almost seemed as if some of the informal spontaneity that characterized Pope Francis' 12-year papacy had returned to the Vatican.

But the message Leo delivered that night was all his own: In seamless English, Spanish and Italian, Leo told the young people that they were the "salt of the Earth, the light of the world." He urged them to spread their hope, faith in Christ and their cries of peace wherever they go.

As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that after 12 sometimes turbulent years under Francis, a certain calm and reserve have returned to the papacy.

Leo seems eager above all to avoid polemics or making the papacy about himself, and wants instead to focus on Christ and peace.

That seems exactly what many Catholic faithful want, and may respond to what today's church needs.

Government forces Air Canada and flight attendants back to work and into arbitration

TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's government forced Air Canada and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration Saturday after a work stoppage stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season.

Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said now is not the time to take risks with the economy, noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. The intervention means the 10,000 flight attendants will return to work soon.

The government's action came less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job.

"The talks broke down. It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator," Hajdu said.

Hajdu said the full resumption of services could take days, noting it is up to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. Meanwhile, Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of the CUPE union, accused the government of violating the flight attendants' constitutional right to strike -- and decried Hajdu for only waiting hours to intervene.


5. Telangana's Future City Project Has No Future: KTR

Hyderabad, Aug 17 (Maxim News): BRS working president K.Tarak Rama Rao said on Sunday that the much-hyped "future city" project had no future. Chief Minister Revanth Reddy's ambition to turn the Hyderabad Pharma City lands into a real estate venture for the benefit of his family and friends would not be fulfilled.

In a statement, Rama Rao condemned the scrapping of the 20,000-acre Pharma City project, spread across 56 villages, initiated by the K. Chandrashekhar Rao government. Farmers had voluntarily parted with their land for the State's industrial growth, but were now being cheated.

"The Congress promised to return every acre to farmers. Instead, it is eyeing these lands for real estate under the guise of 'Future City,' " he said, expressing concern over the fate of the lands allocated to pharma companies.

He said Revanth Reddy was a leader without vision, with his decisions leading to the wastage of public money. "A classic example of what happens when a clueless leader runs the State," he said.

Citing the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, the BRS working president reminded that land acquired for a specific pubic purpose could not be diverted for private business interests. He recalled warning Congress two years ago in the Assembly.

"After spending hundreds of crores on a PR blitz, today even officials admit serious legal hurdles, " he said.

Here To Join Us On WhatsApp

He said the previous BRS government developed infrastructure worth crores of public money for the Pharma City project, but it had been sidelined.

"Public money wasted, farmers betrayed, citizens fooled," he said, warning that the government's actions were against public interest and would cause harm to the people, especially the farmers.

Demanding immediate clarity from the government, Rama Rao warned that if Revaznth Reddy failed to respond, the BRS would fight on behalf of the farmers to protect their lands and future. (Maxim News)

7. Elvish Yadav House Firing: Himanshu Bhau gang CLAIMS responsibility, says 'he promoted betting app that...' | Bollywood Life

Gangsters Neeraj Faridpur and Bhau Ritolia, who are associated with the Himanshu Bhau gang, took credit for the Sunday firing outside the Gurgaon home of Bigg Boss winner and YouTuber Elvish Yadav. Read on to know the reason behind their action.

Bigg Boss OTT 2 winner Elvish Yadav has been in the news today, August 17, after some unidentified gunmen opened fired outside his house in Gurugram's sector 57 on Sunday morning. The incident occurred between 5:30 am and 6 am. According to the officials, three masked men arrived on motorcycles and fired over two dozen rounds at the house. Now in a new development, it has been revealed who was behind the attack.

Gangsters Neeraj Faridpur and Bhau Ritolia, who are associated with the Himanshu Bhau gang, took credit for the Sunday shooting outside the Gurgaon house of Bigg Boss winner and YouTuber Elvish Yadav. The gang accused Yadav of promoting a betting app "that has destroyed many households" in a social media post.

On Instagram, the user Bhau Ritolia posted, "Greetings to all. Today, a shooting took place at ELVISH YADAV's house. It was carried out by NEERAJ FARIDPUR and BHAU RITOLIYA. Today we have made our presence known. He (Elvish Yadav) has destroyed a lot of homes by promoting illegal betting apps. It is a warning to all such insects on social media, like Elvish Yadav.

8. FBI Warns of Fake Law Firms Targeting Crypto Scam Victims

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a stark warning about a sophisticated scam targeting victims of cryptocurrency fraud, where fraudsters pose as legitimate law firms offering to recover lost funds. In a public service announcement released this week, the FBI detailed how these "fictitious law firms" exploit the desperation of individuals who have already suffered significant losses in crypto scams. These imposters often contact victims unsolicited, claiming affiliations with government agencies like the FBI itself or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and promise to retrieve stolen assets for a fee.

According to the announcement, scammers use detailed knowledge of victims' prior losses -- gleaned from public reports or data breaches -- to build trust. They may demand upfront payments in cryptocurrency, wire transfers, or even gift cards, under the guise of covering "legal fees" or "recovery costs." The FBI notes that these schemes have evolved, with fraudsters now incorporating advanced tactics like fake websites, forged documents, and scripted phone calls to mimic real legal proceedings.

Escalating Tactics in Crypto Recovery Fraud

This alert builds on previous FBI advisories, including one from June 2024 that highlighted an uptick in fake recovery services. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, the latest warning emphasizes how scammers combine multiple exploitation methods, such as emotional manipulation and false assurances of government backing. Victims, often still reeling from initial scams involving pig-butchering schemes or fake investment platforms, are particularly vulnerable.

Industry experts point out that the cryptocurrency sector's rapid growth has fueled these secondary scams. With billions lost annually to crypto fraud -- the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center reported over $4 billion in 2023 alone -- the pool of potential targets is vast. Scammers exploit this by creating elaborate personas, complete with professional-looking emails and websites that vanish once payments are secured.

The Mechanics of Deception

Delving deeper, the FBI describes how these fictitious firms often require victims to provide sensitive information, such as wallet addresses or transaction histories, ostensibly for "investigation purposes." This data is then used to perpetrate further fraud or sold on the dark web. In some cases, as outlined in the advisory, scammers pose as recovery specialists who claim to have already "traced" the funds and need only a small payment to release them.

Posts found on X (formerly Twitter) reflect growing public awareness, with users sharing anecdotes of unsolicited contacts from alleged lawyers promising crypto recoveries, often urging caution against such offers. These social media discussions align with the FBI's observations, highlighting how scammers leverage platforms like LinkedIn or Telegram to initiate contact.

Government Response and Victim Reporting

The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has updated its guidance, urging victims to report suspicious activities directly at www.ic3.gov. This PSA is an evolution of earlier alerts, such as the August 2023 notice on companies falsely claiming fund recovery abilities, as detailed in IC3's own publication. Federal authorities emphasize verifying any law firm's legitimacy through state bar associations or official government channels before engaging.

Collaboration with other agencies has intensified, with the FBI working alongside the CFPB to dismantle these networks. Recent enforcement actions, including seizures of fraudulent domains, demonstrate a proactive stance, though the decentralized nature of crypto complicates tracing.

Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry

For industry insiders, this scam underscores systemic vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency ecosystems. Exchanges and wallet providers are increasingly implementing AI-driven fraud detection, but secondary scams like these highlight the need for better consumer education. Analysts from Cointelegraph note that as crypto adoption surges, so does the sophistication of fraud, with scammers adapting to regulatory crackdowns.

Victims' stories, shared in forums and news outlets, reveal patterns: one individual, as reported in Forbes, lost an additional $10,000 to a fake recovery firm after an initial $50,000 scam. Such cases illustrate the compounding financial and emotional toll.

Preventive Measures and Future Outlook

To combat this, the FBI recommends skepticism toward any unsolicited recovery offers, especially those demanding payment upfront. Legitimate firms rarely guarantee results or require fees before services, and they never ask for payments in crypto or gift cards. Industry groups are pushing for standardized verification protocols, potentially integrating blockchain analytics to flag suspicious activities.

Looking ahead, as cryptocurrency regulations tighten globally, experts predict a decline in such scams, but only if education keeps pace. The FBI's ongoing alerts serve as a critical tool, reminding stakeholders that in the high-stakes world of digital assets, vigilance is the first line of defense against layered fraud. With losses mounting, the call is clear: report early, verify thoroughly, and avoid becoming a victim twice over.


9. Senegal's 'schools for husbands' aim to shift gender roles and keep mothers from dying

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- On a recent evening in Senegal 's capital of Dakar, an imam named Ibrahima Diane explained to a group of men why they should be more involved in household chores.

"The Prophet himself says a man who does not help support his wife and children is not a good Muslim," the 53-year-old said, as he described bathing his baby and helping his wife with other duties.

Some of the 14 men chuckled, not quite sold. Others applauded.

Diane was taking part in a "school for husbands," a United Nations-backed initiative where respected male community members learn about "positive masculinity" in health and social issues and promote them in their communities.

In Senegal, as in many other West African countries with large rural or conservative populations, men often have the final say in major household decisions, including ones related to health.

Women may need their permission for life-changing decisions on accessing family planning or other reproductive health services, along with hospital deliveries or prenatal care.

Following his sessions at the school for husbands, Diane regularly holds sermons during Friday prayers where he discusses issues around gender and reproductive health, from gender-based violence to fighting stigma around HIV.

"Many women appreciate my sermons," he said. "They say their husbands' behavior changed since they attended them." He said some men have told him the sermons inspired them to become more caring husbands and fathers.

Habib Diallo, a 60-year-old former army commando, said attending the sermons and discussions with the imam taught him about the risks of home births.

"When my son's wife was pregnant, I encouraged him to take her to the hospital for the delivery," Diallo said. "At first, he was hesitant. He worried about the cost and didn't trust the hospital. But when I explained how much safer it would be for both his wife and the baby, he agreed."

No more barking orders

The program launched in Senegal in 2011 but in recent years has caught the attention of the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, which sees it an effective strategy to combat maternal and infant mortality.

"Without men's involvement, attitudes around maternal health won't change," said 54-year-old Aida Diouf, a female health worker who collaborates with the program. Many husbands prefer their wives not be treated by male health workers, she said.

The classes for husbands follow similar efforts in other African countries, particularly Niger, Togo, and Burkina Faso, where the United Nations Population Fund says it improved women's access to reproductive health services by increasing male involvement, growing the use of contraceptives by both men and women and expanding access to prenatal care and skilled birth attendants.

Discussions for men also have focused on girls' rights, equality and the harmful effects of female genital mutilation.

The program now operates over 20 schools in Senegal, and over 300 men have been trained.

In some communities, men who once enforced patriarchal norms now promote gender equality, which has led to a reduction in the number of forced marriages and more acceptance of family planning, according to Senegal's ministry of gender.

Men join the groups after being recruited based on trust, leadership and commitment. Candidates must be married, respected locally and supportive of women's health and rights.

After training, the men act as peer educators, visiting homes and hosting informal talks.

"My husband used to not do much around the house, just bark orders. Now he actually cooks and helps out with daily tasks," said Khary Ndeye, 52.

Still too many dying in childbirth

While maternal and infant deaths in Senegal have declined over the past decade, experts say it still has a long way to go. It recorded 237 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in 2023, while 21 newborns out of every 1,000 died within their first month. The U.N. globally wants to reduce maternal deaths to 70 deaths per 100,000 live births and newborn deaths to under 12 per 1,000 by 2030.

One key problem was that many women have been giving birth at home, said El Hadj Malick, one of the Senegal program's coordinators.

"By educating men about the importance of supporting their wives during pregnancy, taking them to the hospital and helping with domestic work at home, you're protecting people's health," Malick said.

He said he still experiences difficulty changing mindsets on some issues.

"When we just talk to them about gender, there is sometimes tension because it's seen as something abstract or even foreign," Malick said. Some men mistakenly believe such talk will promote LGBTQ+ issues, which remain largely taboo in much of West Africa.

"But when we focus on women's right to be healthy, it puts a human face on the concept and its becomes universal," Malick said.

10. Manchester United vs Arsenal Preview: Prediction, Team News

Manchester United's decision to invest ¬£65 million plus add-ons in Benjamin Sesko represents one of the most...

The 2025/26 Premier League season kicks off with a bang as Manchester United host Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday, August 17, 2025, at 21:00 IST. This mouth-watering encounter promises to set the tone for both clubs' campaigns after contrasting fortunes in the previous season.

Manchester United endured their worst Premier League season as they finished 15th, while they also lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur. Arsenal's title challenge fizzled out, though they still finished as runners-up for the third consecutive year.

Arsenal will be aiming to fight for the title once more in what is their 100th consecutive season in the English top-flight, the longest ongoing run of any side. The Gunners have historically started seasons well, having won their opening league game in five of the last six seasons, including each of the previous three.

For United, this represents a fresh start under Ruben Amorim, who will be looking to kick the season off on a positive note. The Red Devils have traditionally been strong on opening day, having won their opener in the competition more often than any other side (22) while also having the best win rate on MD 1 of any side to play more than one season (67%).

Both clubs have been active in the transfer market to address their shortcomings from the previous campaign.

The Gunners have concluded deals for Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Cristhian Mosquera, Christian Norgaard and Kepa Arrizabalaga. The most high-profile addition appears to be Viktor Gyokeres, a striker Amorim knows all about from their shared days at Sporting.

United have brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Benjamin Sesko signed just over a week before the meeting with Arsenal, and their trip to Old Trafford could provide the perfect opportunity for the Slovenian striker to make his bow.

Manchester United have lost just two of their last 18 Premier League home games against Arsenal, with both defeats coming under Arteta's management (1-0 in both November 2020 and May 2024).

Remarkably, this is just the second time in English league history United will host Arsenal in their league opener, previously beating the Gunners 4-1 in 1989-90. United have won 99 of their 243 meetings with Arsenal in all competitions (D55 L89). They've only beaten Aston Villa (107) more often, while they would be the first team to beat the Gunners 100 times if they're victorious on Sunday.

Arsenal's strong away form was a highlight of last season, particularly in the second half of the campaign. They head into Sunday's trip unbeaten in their last 14 Premier League away games since a 1-0 loss at Newcastle United in November.

The Gunners have also been prolific at Old Trafford in recent years, scoring in each of their last 11 Premier League visits (14 goals).

United start the Premier League season at home for the ninth successive year, providing them with the comfort of familiar surroundings as they seek to improve on their disappointing previous campaign.

United failed to win consecutive league matches across the whole of last season. But having beaten Aston Villa on the final day of 2024-25, they could win back-to-back outings in the Premier League for the first time since MD 1 of last term.

Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui did not appear in the American leg of Tour 2025, presented by Snapdragon, nor in the Fiorentina friendly back in M16, so updates on that pair, plus any further team news, may be delivered by Amorim in his pre-match press conference.

The visitors are kicking off the season with a relatively clean bill of health. Gabriel Jesus is the most notable absentee, as he is still recovering from a knee injury. Leandro Trossard is the only other concern, having picked up a slight groin strain in the Gunners' pre-season meeting with Tottenham Hotspur.

The 21:00 IST kick-off will be broadcast live on Star Sports Select in India, with live streaming available on JioHotstar from Old Trafford.

Manchester United's hopes of making a winning start to the new campaign are just 29.5%, while the match finished in a draw in 25.4% of the simulations, giving Arsenal approximately a 45% chance of victory.

This clash promises to be a fascinating encounter between two clubs with vastly different expectations for the season ahead. Arsenal will view this as a must-win to establish early momentum in their title charge, while United desperately need a positive result to restore confidence after their dismal previous campaign.


11. Air Canada says it is restarting flights Sunday

TORONTO (AP) -- Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian government intervened and forced the airline and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration.

The strike stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season.

The country's largest airline said in a release that the first flights will resume Sunday evening but that it will take several days before its operations return to normal. It said some flights will be canceled over the next seven to 10 days until the schedule is stabilized.

Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. Hajdu referred the work stoppage to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.

The airline said Sunday the Canada Industrial Relations Board has extended the term of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.

The shutdown of Canada's largest airline early Saturday was impacting about 130,000 people a day. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.

According to numbers from aviation analytics provider Cirium, Air Canada had canceled a total of 671 flights by Saturday afternoon -- following 199 on Friday. And another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.

The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada's prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.

Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.

Last year, the government forced the country's two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union's leverage in negotiations.

The Business Council of Canada had urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too. And the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed the intervention.

Hajdu maintained that her Liberal government is not anti-union, saying it is clear the two sides are at an impasse.

Passengers whose flights are impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.

The airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full "due to the summer travel peak."

Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal.

Both sides have said they remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.

The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said "would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada."

But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.

13. Older Americans Over 50 Embrace AI Amid Health and Finance Mistrust

In an era where artificial intelligence permeates everything from voice assistants to healthcare diagnostics, older Americans are emerging as unexpected enthusiasts. Recent surveys reveal that more than half of adults over 50 are engaging with AI technologies, often through everyday tools like smart speakers or virtual assistants. This shift challenges the stereotype that seniors shy away from cutting-edge tech, showing instead a pragmatic embrace driven by convenience and necessity.

Yet, this adoption comes with caveats. While many older users appreciate AI's role in enhancing daily life -- such as reminding them of medications or providing companionship -- trust remains a significant barrier. A study highlighted in Fast Company underscores that although 55% of seniors have interacted with conversational AI like Amazon's Alexa, a substantial portion expresses skepticism about its reliability, particularly in sensitive areas like health advice.

Trust Deficits in Health and Finance

Diving deeper, the mistrust is especially pronounced in domains where accuracy is paramount. According to a 2024 survey reported by U.S. News & World Report, most Americans aged 50 and older harbor doubts about AI-generated health information, with only a minority viewing it as trustworthy. This wariness stems from high-profile incidents of AI errors, such as hallucinated medical advice from chatbots, leading seniors to prefer human expertise for critical decisions.

Financial planning echoes similar sentiments. Northwestern Mutual's 2025 Planning & Progress Study, detailed in Financial Advisor Magazine, finds that while nearly one-third of Americans use AI personally or at work, the vast majority -- especially older cohorts -- favor human advisors over algorithms for managing investments or retirement plans. The study notes that 70% believe AI should never make decisions without human oversight, reflecting broader anxieties about algorithmic bias and opacity.

Usage Patterns and Generational Nuances

How exactly are seniors incorporating AI? Research from The Conversation indicates that voice-activated devices top the list, with 96% of users over 50 reporting benefits for independent living, such as home security enhancements that make them feel safer. Chatbots, however, lag in popularity, often due to concerns over privacy and data security -- issues amplified by posts on X where users discuss AI's potential to erode personal connections.

Generational differences add layers to this narrative. Pew Research Center's 2025 analysis, available at Pew Research Center, shows that while younger Americans might experiment with AI for creative tasks, seniors lean toward practical applications. Yet, overall public concern has grown; 52% of Americans express more worry than excitement about AI's daily role, a figure that climbs among older demographics wary of rapid technological change.

Concerns Over Regulation and Future Implications

Regulatory gaps exacerbate these trust issues. Pew's earlier reports, like the 2023 findings on growing public concern, highlight that half of Americans believe AI development is advancing too quickly without sufficient safeguards. Seniors, in particular, voice fears about misuse, from AI-driven scams targeting vulnerable populations to automated systems denying healthcare claims, as noted in X discussions criticizing AI in Medicare and Social Security services.

Looking ahead, experts suggest bridging this trust gap requires transparent AI design and education. Initiatives like those from SingularityNET, referenced in X posts, pose critical questions about AGI's societal impact, urging a balanced approach. For industry insiders, the message is clear: tailoring AI for seniors means prioritizing reliability and human-AI collaboration to foster genuine adoption.

Bridging the Gap Through Innovation

Innovators are responding. Companies are developing AI tools with built-in verification layers, such as hybrid systems combining machine learning with expert oversight, as explored in MIT Technology Review's coverage of AI in neurodegenerative disease detection. This could alleviate concerns, especially as dementia risks rise -- a point echoed in X warnings about AI's potential cognitive effects on users.

Ultimately, while older Americans are dipping into AI more than expected, sustained trust will depend on addressing their specific vulnerabilities. As one X post from privacy advocate Kohei Kurihara notes, studies like those in TechXplore reveal ongoing struggles with data privacy, signaling that the path forward involves not just technological prowess but ethical foresight to ensure AI serves rather than alienates this growing user base.


14. Zelensky claims Russia 'complicating' ceasefire efforts as PM meets allies

Russia is complicating efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to meet with European leaders to discuss the war.

The so-called coalition of the willing, the alliance which is planning to police a future peace deal in Ukraine, will meet on Sunday afternoon amid reports Donald Trump favours a Russian land grab to end the war.

Following the Alaska summit between Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin on Friday, the American leader suggested he wants to move straight to a full peace deal, rather than negotiating a ceasefire first.

The shift in Mr Trump's position appears to echo the Russians' refusal to agree to ceasefire before engaging in peace talks.

Several news outlets have cited sources which claimed that during the negotiations Mr Putin demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops.

Other outlets reported that Mr Trump is inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelensky about it when they meet in the Oval Office.

Writing on social media on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian leader railed against Russia's refusal to lay down arms temporarily before agreeing to end the war.

Mr Zelensky said: "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing.

"This complicates the situation."

He added: "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades.

"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war."

The Prime Minister, alongside French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz, will host the coalition of the willing on Sunday afternoon.

The video conference will see allies who plan to keep the peace in Ukraine gather ahead of Mr Zelensky's visit to Washington on Monday.

The Ukrainian leader is expected to attend the Sunday afternoon video call, which is scheduled to take place at 2pm UK time.

Friday's summit between Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, ended without any commitment towards a ceasefire.

The Russian president described it as "timely" and "useful" after he left.

Mr Trump afterwards suggested it was time for Mr Zelensky to make a deal to end the war.

Sir Keir commended Mr Trump's "pursuit of an end to the killing", but insisted Ukraine's leader must not be excluded from future talks to broker a peace in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister and European leaders appeared increasingly confident that Mr Trump will offer a "security guarantee" of air support to back up allied troops on the ground in Ukraine, should they be deployed to keep the peace.

Experts have warned the face-to-face summit has risked legitimising the Russian leader, who has been made a pariah by the international community for invading Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky has warned Russia may ramp up its strikes against his country in the coming days "in order to create more favourable political circumstances for talks with global actors".


15. US Carbon Emissions Jump 4.2% in 2025, Surpassing China's Decline

In a striking reversal of long-term trends, the United States has seen its carbon emissions climb in the first half of 2025, while China's have declined, marking a pivotal moment in global climate dynamics. Data from Carbon Monitor, an international scientific initiative tracking real-time emissions, shows U.S. CO2 output rose by 4.2% compared to the same period in 2024, driven largely by a resurgence in coal-fired power generation. Meanwhile, China's emissions dropped 2.7%, fueled by aggressive renewable energy expansion and favorable weather patterns that reduced coal dependency.

This shift challenges assumptions about the world's top polluters, with the U.S. potentially reclaiming its position as the leading emitter if trends persist. Analysts point to domestic factors in the U.S., including increased electricity demand from data centers and electric vehicles, which have strained grids and prompted utilities to lean on existing coal plants. According to a report in E&E News by POLITICO, coal generation in the U.S. jumped 14% in the first half of the year, reversing years of decline.

Coal's Unexpected Comeback in America

Europe, too, experienced a 4.6% emissions increase, attributed to its rapid decarbonization efforts backfiring amid energy supply disruptions. In contrast, India's emissions fell 2.2%, thanks to a boom in wind and solar power, which now make up 14% of its energy mix, up from 11% last year, as noted by the International Energy Agency. Weather played a role here, with an early monsoon cooling temperatures and curbing coal use, though the IEA forecasts a rebound later in 2025.

On the policy front, the U.S. withdrawal from international climate accords under previous administrations has left it vulnerable, while China's commitments under its 14th Five-Year Plan appear to be paying off. Posts on X highlight growing sentiment that China's green tech dominance -- evident in its electric vehicle and solar sectors -- could see it peak emissions ahead of schedule, potentially by 2025, outpacing sluggish U.S. transitions.

China's Renewable Surge and Economic Drivers

Delving deeper, China's decline stems from a massive scale-up in clean energy. The country added photovoltaic capacity to 890 GW and wind to 520 GW in 2024 alone, reducing energy storage costs to $66 per kWh, as discussed in analyses on X and corroborated by the Climate Action Tracker. This has not only cut emissions but also boosted economic growth, with clean tech sectors contributing over 10% to GDP, reaching $1.9 trillion in investments and sales.

Conversely, U.S. emissions growth underscores challenges in infrastructure. A piece in The Energy Mix details how rising fossil gas use and coal revivals undermine net-zero goals, even as renewables expand. Industry insiders note that without accelerated grid modernization and policy incentives like those in the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. risks falling further behind.

Global Implications for Energy Markets

Looking ahead, this divergence could reshape international climate negotiations, especially at COP30, where China has pledged an updated Nationally Determined Contribution by 2035. Experts from the World Economic Forum, in their Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2025 report, rank China 12th globally for its clean energy leadership, highlighting its electricity emissions hitting record lows.

For energy executives and policymakers, the takeaway is clear: China's model of state-driven renewable deployment offers lessons in scalability, while the U.S. must address demand-side pressures. As one X post from energy analysts observed, if U.S. coal use continues rising as projected by the IEA -- potentially up overall in 2025 -- global emissions trajectories may hinge more on Beijing than Washington. This shift not only alters pollution patterns but signals a reordering of economic power in the clean energy era, urging swift adaptations across sectors.


16. Roblox Enacts Safety Reforms Amid Lawsuits and Child Protection Concerns

In the fast-evolving world of online gaming, Roblox Corp. has found itself at the center of a storm over child safety, prompting sweeping changes to its platform policies amid mounting legal and regulatory pressure. On August 16, 2025, the company announced measures to restrict unrated user-generated experiences, automatically remove servers hosting violative content, and limit certain social hangouts to verified users aged 17 and older. These steps come as Roblox grapples with lawsuits alleging it prioritizes profits over protecting young users from predators and harmful interactions.

The announcements followed a sharp decline in Roblox's stock, which closed down 6.34% on Friday, as reported by Bloomberg. Industry observers see this as a direct response to escalating scrutiny, including a recent lawsuit filed by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, who accused the platform of endangering children through lax moderation.

Legal Battles Intensify

Details from the lawsuit, highlighted in a UPI report, claim Roblox's algorithms and features facilitate predatory behavior, allowing adults to interact inappropriately with minors. This isn't isolated; multiple child safety lawsuits have plagued the company, with plaintiffs arguing that its vast ecosystem of user-created games -- numbering in the millions -- creates unchecked risks.

Roblox's corporate response, detailed on its own blog, emphasizes a commitment to safety, stating it has invested heavily in AI-driven moderation tools. Yet critics, including journalist Paul Tassi in a Forbes piece, point out that figures like former "To Catch a Predator" host Chris Hansen have amplified concerns about the platform's "predator problem," urging more robust interventions.

Policy Overhauls and Implementation

Under the new rules, outlined in Roblox's Developer Forum, unrated experiences will be accessible only to their creators, effectively curbing the spread of potentially harmful content. The company also plans to enhance age verification for social features, a move echoed in an Engadget analysis by Jackson Chen, who notes it addresses long-standing criticisms from child advocacy groups.

These changes build on prior efforts, such as increased parental controls, but insiders question their sufficiency. A post on X from user News v2 on August 15, 2025, highlighted broader tech industry trends, including AI safety debates, which parallel Roblox's challenges in balancing innovation with ethical oversight.

Market and Industry Repercussions

The financial ripple effects are evident: Roblox's market cap took a hit, reflecting investor jitters over regulatory risks in the user-generated content space. Broader web searches reveal similar sentiments, with a Medium article by Abhishek Monpara discussing AI and tech safety trends that could influence gaming platforms like Roblox.

Competitors are watching closely; for instance, Epic Games' Fortnite has faced analogous issues but implemented stricter controls earlier. Roblox's moves may set a precedent, as noted in a Gizmodo piece by Lucas Ropek, which alleges the platform's profit-driven model exacerbates safety lapses.

Future Challenges and Innovations

Looking ahead, Roblox must navigate not just legal hurdles but also technological advancements. Integration of more sophisticated AI for real-time content monitoring, as suggested in X posts about emerging 2025 tech trends like agentic AI, could be key. A OpenTools.ai report on GPT-5's launch this month underscores how advanced models might bolster moderation, though ethical concerns persist.

For industry insiders, Roblox's saga underscores the tension between fostering creativity and ensuring safety in digital realms. As the company refines its tools -- potentially including partnerships with AI firms -- the outcome could reshape standards for online platforms catering to youth. Failure to adapt risks further lawsuits and reputational damage, while success might restore investor confidence amid a volatile tech sector.

18. J&K Cloudburst Tragedy: 7 Dead, Including 5 Children, Flash Floods Devastate Kathua | Odisha Bytes

Kathua: A devastating cloudburst in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district has claimed the lives of at least seven people, including five children, as flash floods inundated villages and wreaked havoc in the region. Dramatic rescue operations, captured in heart-wrenching videos circulating on social media, are ongoing as authorities scramble to recover bodies and provide aid to the affected families.

The cloudburst struck early this morning, triggering flash floods that swept through the area, destroying homes, roads, and vehicles in its path. The region, which has been grappling with heavy rains in recent days, saw rapid devastation as torrents of water surged through residential areas.

Disturbing Social Media Videos Capture Desperate Rescue Efforts

Social media videos have brought the gravity of the situation to light, showing dramatic scenes of villagers and rescue teams battling powerful floodwaters to save those trapped. One video shows a group of locals using ropes to pull a young girl from the swollen river, while another depicts rescue teams struggling to navigate through the debris-filled waters. The rescue footage, which has shocked viewers, underscores the perilous conditions on the ground.

Omar Abdullah Condemns Tragedy

Omar Abdullah, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, expressed his deep sorrow over the incident and offered condolences to the grieving families. In a tweet, he wrote: "Heartbreaking news from Kathua. A cloudburst has led to flash floods, taking lives, including young children. My thoughts are with the victims and their families. I assure that rescue and relief operations are in full swing to help those affected." Abdullah also assured the public that the administration was working round the clock to provide aid to the affected areas.

Casualties and Aftermath

The flash floods have killed at least seven people, including five children, with more feared dead as rescue operations continue. The children were reportedly playing near their homes when the floodwaters struck. Many homes have been completely destroyed, and roads leading to the affected areas have been cut off, hampering relief efforts.

While the rescue teams are working tirelessly, there is still a significant risk of more casualties as flash floods remain a threat in the region. The Jammu and Kashmir administration has warned of the possibility of further cloudbursts and advised residents to stay alert and avoid flood-prone areas.

Ongoing Rescue and Relief Operations

The Jammu and Kashmir Disaster Management Authority (JKDMA), along with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), has been deployed to assist in the rescue operations. Helicopters are being used for aerial surveillance and to deliver essential supplies to the affected areas. Medical teams have been sent to treat the injured, and shelters are being set up for displaced people.

However, access to the worst-hit regions remains challenging due to washed-out roads and landslides, complicating relief efforts.

20. Navigating AI Evolution: Tracking Tools for 2025 Leadership

In an era where artificial intelligence evolves at breakneck speed, staying abreast of its advancements has become a critical imperative for businesses, policymakers, and researchers alike. The sheer volume of breakthroughs -- from generative models to ethical frameworks -- demands sophisticated monitoring tools that go beyond casual news feeds. Enter platforms dedicated to AI tracking, which aggregate data, analyze trends, and provide actionable insights, helping stakeholders navigate this rapidly shifting terrain.

One such resource is the website TrackingAI.org, which serves as a comprehensive hub for monitoring AI developments. Launched to democratize access to AI intelligence, it compiles real-time updates on innovations, regulatory changes, and industry shifts, drawing from global sources to offer a centralized view.

Emerging Tools for AI Surveillance

Recent innovations in AI monitoring technologies underscore the need for automated systems that can sift through vast information streams. For instance, according to reports from TechCrunch, companies are increasingly deploying machine learning algorithms to track AI ethics debates and technological leaps, such as the rise of autonomous agents capable of independent decision-making. These tools not only aggregate news but also predict potential impacts, like how quantum computing integrations could accelerate AI capabilities by 2025.

On social platforms like X (formerly Twitter), users are buzzing about AI-powered workflows that summarize web changes and deliver alerts via channels like Slack. Posts from developers highlight tools that monitor competitors and industry docs, emphasizing real-time sentiment analysis to gauge market moods -- echoing sentiments in a Artificial Intelligence News update on sentiment-ranking aggregators.

The Regulatory Imperative in AI Tracking

As AI permeates sectors from healthcare to finance, tracking regulatory developments has gained urgency. The Global AI Law and Policy Tracker from the International Association of Privacy Professionals details legislative efforts in key jurisdictions, revealing a patchwork of policies aimed at mitigating risks like data biases. In 2025, with only 2% of organizations deemed AI-ready per a WebProNews analysis, monitoring these gaps is essential to avoid innovation stalls.

Industry insiders point to sustainable AI advances, where tracking focuses on green innovations amid data center energy challenges. A Bessemer Venture Partners report on the State of AI 2025 predicts a surge in agentic AI -- systems that perform tasks autonomously -- urging firms to integrate tracking with IoT and blockchain for enhanced efficiency.

Breakthroughs Shaping the Future

Delving deeper, recent breakthroughs chronicled in IEEE Spectrum include advancements in large language models and deepfakes, with monitoring tech evolving to detect manipulations in real-time. South Korean startup Upstage's new model, as covered in a Moneycontrol update, enters the global fray, promising enhanced natural language processing that could redefine AI interactions.

Meanwhile, X discussions rave about apps like NewsBang, which use AI to filter noise, provide multi-perspective summaries, and even convert news into podcasts, aligning with trends in ScienceDaily's coverage of human-like computer intelligence models.

Challenges and Ethical Considerations

Yet, tracking AI isn't without hurdles. Information overload and biases plague even advanced systems, as noted in Analytics India Magazine. Ethical controversies, including those around autonomous AI risks, demand vigilant monitoring to balance innovation with accountability.

For industry leaders, platforms like TrackingAI.org represent a vital starting point, but combining them with diverse sources -- such as The Guardian's analyses or Medium trend forecasts -- ensures a holistic view. As 2025 unfolds, mastering AI tracking could well determine who leads in this transformative field.

1. Bolivia heads to the polls as its right-wing opposition eyes first victory in decades

LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Bolivians headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in presidential and congressional elections that could spell the end of the Andean nation's long-dominant leftist party and see a right-wing government elected for the first time in over two decades.

The election on Sunday is one of the most consequential for Bolivia in recent times -- and one of the most unpredictable.

Even at this late stage, a remarkable 30% or so of voters remain undecided. Polls show the two leading right-wing candidates, multimillionaire business owner Samuel Doria Medina and former President Jorge Fernando "Tuto" Quiroga, locked in a virtual dead heat.

Many undecided voters

But a right-wing victory isn't assured. Many longtime voters for the governing Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, now shattered by infighting, live in rural areas and tend to be undercounted in polling.

With the nation's worst economic crisis in four decades leaving Bolivians waiting for hours in fuel lines, struggling to find subsidized bread and squeezed by double-digit inflation, the opposition candidates are billing the race as a chance to alter the country's destiny.

"I have rarely, if ever, seen a situational tinderbox with as many sparks ready to ignite," Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, founding partner of Aurora Macro Strategies, a New York-based advisory firm, writes in a memo. Breaking the MAS party's monopoly on political power, he adds, pushes "the country into uncharted political waters amid rising polarization, severe economic fragility and a widening rural-urban divide."

Bolivia could follow rightward trend

The outcome will determine whether Bolivia -- a nation of about 12 million people with the largest lithium reserves on Earth and crucial deposits of rare earth minerals -- follows a growing trend in Latin America, where right-wing leaders like Argentina's libertarian Javier Milei, Ecuador's strongman Daniel Noboa and El Salvador's conservative populist Nayib Bukele have surged in popularity.

A right-wing government in Bolivia could trigger a major geopolitical realignment for a country now allied with Venezuela's socialist-inspired government and world powers such as China, Russia and Iran.

Conservative candidates vow to restore US relations

Doria Medina and Quiroga have praised the Trump administration and vowed to restore ties with the United States -- ruptured in 2008 when charismatic, long-serving former President Evo Morales expelled the American ambassador.

The right-wing front-runners also have expressed interest in doing business with Israel, which has no diplomatic relations with Bolivia, and called for foreign private companies to invest in the country and develop its rich natural resources.

After storming to office in 2006 at the start of the commodities boom, Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, nationalized the nation's oil and gas industry, using the lush profits to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure and improve the lives of the rural poor.

After three consecutive presidential terms, as well as a contentious bid for an unprecedented fourth in 2019 that set off popular unrest and led to his ouster, Morales has been barred from this race by Bolivia's constitutional court.

His ally-turned-rival, President Luis Arce, withdrew his candidacy for the MAS on account of his plummeting popularity and nominated his senior minister, Eduardo del Castillo.

As the party splintered, Andr√≥nico Rodr√≠guez, the 36-year-old president of the senate who hails from the same union of coca farmers as Morales, launched his bid.

Ex-president Morales urges supports to deface ballots

Rather than back the candidate widely considered his heir, Morales, holed up in his tropical stronghold and evading an arrest warrant on charges related to his relationship with a 15-year-old girl, has urged his supporters to deface their ballots or leave them blank.

Voting is mandatory in Bolivia, where some 7.9 million Bolivians are eligible to vote.

Doria Medina and Quiroga, familiar faces in Bolivian politics who both served in past neoliberal governments and have run for president three times before, have struggled to stir up interest as voter angst runs high.

"There's enthusiasm for change but no enthusiasm for the candidates," said Eddy Abasto, 44, a Tupperware vendor in Bolivia's capital of La Paz torn between voting for Doria Medina and Quiroga. "It's always the same, those in power live happily spending the country's money, and we suffer."

Conservative candidates say austerity needed

Doria Medina and Quiroga have warned of the need for a painful fiscal adjustment, including the elimination of Bolivia's generous food and fuel subsidies, to save the nation from insolvency. Some analysts caution this risks sparking social unrest.

"A victory for either right-wing candidate could have grave repercussions for Bolivia's Indigenous and impoverished communities," said Kathryn Ledebur, director of the Andean Information Network, a Bolivian research group. "Both candidates could bolster security forces and right-wing para-state groups, paving the way for violent crackdowns on protests expected to erupt over the foreign exploitation of lithium and drastic austerity measures."

All 130 seats in Bolivia's Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament, are up for grabs, along with 36 in the Senate, the upper house.

If, as is widely expected, no one receives more than 50% of the vote, or 40% of the vote with a lead of 10 percentage points, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on Oct. 19 for the first time since Bolivia's 1982 return to democracy.


2. Sunday storm chances, high humidity continues | Aug 17, 2025

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) - More rain chances could be possible today. It will remain incredibly humid with the '90s continuing for early next week.

We saw some showers and thunderstorms overnight that produced some gusty winds, lots of lightning and even an inch or more of rainfall across the metro area. Dry conditions start off this morning but more rain is off to the north of us.

TODAY: There's a chance for some showers and thunderstorms on and off throughout the day today. It will continue to be incredibly humid. Look for a partly to mostly cloudy sky throughout the afternoon. Due to the rain chances and the cloud cover temperatures will likely not hit the lower 90s in Indianapolis. It will still feel very uncomfortable with the high humidity values.

TONIGHT: Drying out later tonight Look for partly cloudy skies with low temperatures falling into the lower '70s.

TOMORROW: Mostly sunny skies for your Monday it is going to be incredibly hot and humid. High temperatures will climb into the lower '90s. Heat indices or feels like temperatures will top out into the upper 90s near 100.

7 DAY EXTENDED FORECAST: Another hot and humid day on Tuesday but this time we'll look for a good chance for some showers and thunderstorms. High temperatures will climb into the lower 90s.

Temperatures begin to drop along with humidity values for the middle part of the work week. Scattered showers and storms on Wednesday with highs in the lower 80s. Thursday we will see temperatures today into the lower '80s under partly cloudy skies. We may see temperatures pick up a little bit into the mid '80s for the end of the week and early next weekend.

Quick trip out in the Atlantic where hurricane Erin is a powerful storm. The first major hurricane of the season continues to turn westward. It does look like it will make a right turn and not make landfall on the east coast of the United States.


3. Why In The World Did The Boeing 777X Fly To Mexico?

In 2024, Mexico's Toluca International Airport (TLC) was seen hosting Boeing 777X test flights. While the Boeing 777X was not the first aircraft to conduct flight testing at Toluca, it does appear to be uncommon for Boeing to test its aircraft there. The Boeing 777X has been flying for five years now, having first flown in 2020. Boeing had planned for it to already be in service, but the aircraft has experienced FAA certification delays.

The delays have been aggravated by a collapse in confidence in Boeing's quality assurance and transparency after it misled the FAA about the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) software on its 737 MAX aircraft. New technologies like the 777X's folding wingtips are also likely delaying its certification, requiring extensive testing. Here is what to know about why the 777X was tested in Mexico and why it needs to be tested outside of the United States.

What To Know About Mexico's High-Altitude Toluca Airport

Toluca International Airport (officially Aeropuerto Internacional Licenciado Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos) serves the city of Toluca, not far from Mexico City. It also functions as a secondary airport for the Greater Mexico City area and is the fifth-busiest city in Mexico. In 2024, the airport served around 1.7 million passengers and hosts cargo, scheduled passenger, charter, and other operations.

While designated as an international airport, the only scheduled passenger airlines operating there are Viva and Volaris. These airlines operate flights to other domestic Mexican destinations like Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Monterrey, San Jose del Cabo, and Tijuana. Notably for Boeing, Toluca is also located at an altitude of around 8,465 feet and has a 13,800-foot runway.

This makes it a great destination for testing aircraft in hot weather and at high altitude. These tests assess an aircraft's performance operating in these environments. Here, the warm air is less dense, reducing the lift generated by the wings and the thrust generated by the engines. The tests determine the aircraft's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) at higher altitudes and the aircraft's pressurization. This is all feeds into what is published in the aircraft's operations manual.

Boeing's 777X Tests In Toluca

A year ago, in August 2024, Boeing conducted "Hot & High" testing with a Boeing 777X (specifically 777-9), WH003/N779XY aircraft in Toluca. While there, Boeing tested the 777X's engine, aerodynamic, and overall handling performance. This was part of the (still ongoing) FAA certification process. After the Boeing 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, the FAA's confidence in Boeing was shaken. The FAA is still withholding type certificates for the MAX 7, MAX 10, and 777X.

Toluca is not a primary testing site for Boeing, with Boeing Field in Seattle and Colorado Springs being more prominent test sites. However, it can be used for high-altitude testing thanks to its elevation and challenging conditions. Toluca is not a regular testing hub for Boeing, but has been utilized on occasion for specific programs like the 777X.

Toluca International Airport (TLC)

Altitude:

8,465 feet

Location:

Toluca, State of Mexico, Mexico

Passenger airlines:

Viva, Volaris

Passengers:

1.4 million in 2024

This suggests that Boeing's choice of Toluca is not a routine decision, and it's unclear why Boeing chose it in 2024. These high-altitude tests more commonly take place at the more extreme El Alto International Airport in La Paz, Bolivia. It is unclear what circumstances made Boeing select Toluca in 2024. There appear to be no open records of Boeing testing other aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 Next Generation, 737 MAX, 757, or 787 Dreamliner, at Toluca.

Airbus Testing The A330-900neo In Toluca

Boeing is not alone in testing aircraft in Toluca. In March 2024, Airbus conducted similar "Hot & High" flight testing with its A330-900neo aircraft registered F-WTTN. This was part of a broader test program for the A330neo that included tests in La Paz. The tests allowed the A330neo to be certified to operate at airports up to 12,500 feet in elevation.

Like the 777X, the A330neo is a modernization of an older 1990s-era widebody aircraft. Both of these aircraft have received new wings for better aerodynamic performance and new engines. The A330neo's new lengthened wing replaced the suboptimal wing it shared with the related A340 quad-engine. Being designed for both a twin and quad-engined aircraft, the old wing was suboptimal for both. Meanwhile, the 777X's wing is notable for having folding wingtips, allowing it to have better aerodynamic performance and remain within airport Code E regulations.

The 777X is exclusively powered by the massive GE Aerospace GE9X turbofan. This is the largest commercial engine ever made. The A330neo is exclusively powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000. The 777X has so far attracted around 551 firm orders, all of which are from international customers, with more than half being from Emirates and Qatar Airways. The A330neo has attracted fewer orders, although its orders have gained traction in 2025 as Vietjet, Malaysia Airlines, and aircraft lessor Avolon placed significant orders.

Aircraft Testing At El Alto International Airport

La Paz is famously the highest capital city in the world, and at 13,325 feet, El Alto International Airport is the world's highest international airport. This makes it a great destination for aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus to conduct high-altitude flight testing. High-altitude conditions at large commercial airports don't get much more extreme than those at La Paz.

Boeing has tested the Boeing 737 MAX 8, Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, and several other aircraft. Although it's unclear if Boeing has tested all its aircraft, like the 757 and earlier 777s, there. Airbus has tested the A330-900, the A350-1000, and other aircraft there. It's unclear if all Airbus aircraft, like the A320 or A380, were tested at El Alto. Bombardier also tested some of its aircraft there, although it's unclear if Embraer has used the airport for testing.

El Alto International Airport (LPB)

Altitude:

13,325 feet

Location:

La Paz, Bolivia

Passengers:

2.6 million (2023)

Key airlines:

Boliviana de Aviaci√≥n, LATAM, Avianca

El Alto's thin air limits the payload capacity of some widebody aircraft like the Boeing 747 and A330. The airport has seen issues in the past, e.g., the Eastern Air Lines Boeing 727 crash of 1985. In 2019, FlightGlobal reported that Bolivian authorities even temporarily suspended operations of Boeing 737 Classics at the airport due to landing gear failures. In 2018, the BBC reported a Peruvian 737-300 skidded off the runway, although it's unclear if these incidents were related to the airport's altitude.

Testing In The United States

Boeing conducts many of its tests at Boeing Field, otherwise known as King County International Airport (BFI) in Seattle. It was the primary airport serving Seattle until Seattle-Tacoma opened in 1944. However, the airport is only set at 21 feet above sea level. By contrast, a large number of tests are conducted at Colorado Springs Airport (COS), which sits at 6,187 feet above sea level.

Boeing has tested the Boeing 777X, 787 Dreamliner, and other aircraft at Colorado Springs. But while it has a high elevation by US airport standards and is considered challenging conditions for aircraft, it is far lower than El Alto and even Mexico's Toluca. It's unclear if Airbus has tested aircraft at Colorado Springs. One of the 777X prototypes, registered as N779XX, conducted high-elevation testing at Colorado Springs Airport in February 2024.

At the time, the 777X operated under the callsign "Boeing 002 Heavy," and it performed eight takeoffs and landings using Colorado Springs' Runway 17L. After that, Boeing moved on to testing the 777X at Mexico's higher Toluca airport. It's unclear if the 777X then moved onto El Alto or not. While Boeing can conduct most flight testing in the US, it lacks the high-altitude airports of other countries where these aircraft are expected to operate.

Clearing The Way For The 777X Introduction

FAA certification for the Boeing 777X is still expected to be granted later in 2025, and the aircraft is expected to enter service in 2026. That said, it is not guaranteed that the FAA will award the type certificate for the 777X (or MAX 7 and MAX 10) in the coming months. After the tests in early and mid-2024, Boeing resumed test flights on its 777X in 2025.

The Boeing 777X has failed to attract a single order in either North or South America. The 777X is seen as too big for giant airlines like United Airlines, which operate around half a dozen dispersed hubs. However, it is well-suited for long-haul carriers like Qatar Airways and Emirates that operate a massive, singular hub.

In 2025, Boeing is only delivering Boeing 737s (specifically MAX 8s and MAX 9s) and Boeing 787s as passenger aircraft. This is because the Boeing 767 is only produced as a freighter and military aircraft, and the final passenger orders for the previous-generation 777-300ER have been delivered, except for a few questionable Pakistan International Airlines orders still on the books. In 2025, Boeing is only delivering freighter 777s as it readies the 777X for service in 2026.

Trump reverses on the need for a ceasefire before a potential peace deal ending the war in Ukraine

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- U.S. President Donald Trump reversed course in the wake of his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to say an overall peace agreement -- not the ceasefire that he has long championed -- is the next step in ending the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine.

In talks with European allies after Friday's summit in Alaska, Trump said Putin reiterated that he wants the key Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up the Donbas. But Putin appeared open to the possibility of halting the stalemate in two other regions, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, with a freeze along the front lines.

That is according to European officials familiar with the calls who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks at a U.S. military base between the American and Russian presidents. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected giving up the territory in the Donbas.

The aftermath of the summit offered little clarity about the next steps, other than Trump's commitment for more meetings, including with Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. It was unclear among those briefed on the exchanges whether Trump saw Putin's desire for the Donbas as acceptable, with Trump's blunt but elliptical way of speaking only adding to a sense of confusion.

The White House had yet to provide a public summary of the calls as Trump golfed on Saturday with his special envoy Steve Witkoff and Fox News anchor Bret Baier at his Virginia golf club. The most transparent takeaway was Trump's abrupt reversal on a ceasefire, raising questions of how peace talks can proceed if attacks continue.

Summit puts Putin back on the global stage and Trump echoes a Kremlin position

In Alaska, President Vladimir Putin walked on a red carpet, shook hands and exchanged smiles with his American counterpart. Donald Trump ended the summit praising their relationship and calling Russia "a big power ... No. 2 in the world," albeit admitting they didn't reach a deal on ending the war in Ukraine.

By Saturday morning Moscow time, Trump appeared to have abandoned the idea of a ceasefire as a step toward peace -- something he and Ukraine had pushed for months -- in favor of pursuing a full-fledged "Peace Agreement" to end the war, echoing a long-held Kremlin position. The "severe consequences" he threatened against Moscow for continuing hostilities were nowhere in sight. On Ukraine's battlefields, Russian troops slowly grinded on, with time on their side.

The hastily arranged Alaska summit "produced nothing for Mr. Trump and gave Mr. Putin most of what he was looking for," said Laurie Bristow, a former British ambassador to Russia.

Putin's visit to Alaska was his first to the United States in 10 years and his first to a Western country since invading Ukraine in 2022 and plunging U.S.-Russia relations to the lowest point since the Cold War. Crippling sanctions followed, along with efforts to shun Russia on the global stage.

The International Criminal Court in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin on accusations of war crimes, casting a shadow on his foreign trips and contacts with other world leaders.

Category 4 Hurricane Erin buffets northern Caribbean islands but not forecast to hit land

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Hurricane Erin exploded in strength and became a major storm in Atlantic waters just north of the Caribbean on Saturday, rapidly powering up from a tropical storm in a single day and bringing heavy rains and high winds to islands in the region.

The first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, Erin reached Category 5 status before weakening somewhat and becoming a Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Late Saturday night, the center reported that Erin was "undergoing structural changes" but was still "formidable" as its rain and winds buffeted Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

The storm's center was about 145 miles (230 kilometers) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and it was heading toward the west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph). It was not forecast to make a direct hit on land.

Hurricane center director Mike Brennen said Erin grew into a "very powerful hurricane," with its winds gaining 60 mph (96 kph) in about nine hours.

Three Republican-led states to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three Republican-led states said Saturday that they were deploying hundreds of National Guard members to the nation's capital to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in Washington through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.

West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400 Guard troops, while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio says it will send 150 in the coming days, marking a significant escalation of the federal intervention.

The moves came as protesters pushed back on federal law enforcement and National Guard troops fanning out in the heavily Democratic city following President Donald Trump's executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members.

By adding outside troops to the existing D.C. Guard deployment and federal law enforcement presence, Trump is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though city officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.

National Guard members have played a limited role in the federal intervention so far, and it's unclear why additional troops are needed. They have been patrolling at landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station and assisting law enforcement with tasks including crowd control.

Israel prepares to move Palestinians to southern Gaza as Israelis urge mass protest over war

NAHARIYA, Israel (AP) -- Israel announced Saturday that it is preparing to move Palestinians from combat zones to southern Gaza as plans move ahead for a military offensive in some of the territory's most populated areas.

The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said the supply of tents to the territory would resume on Sunday. The military said it had no comment on when the mass movement of Palestinians would begin, but Defense Minister Israel Katz said on social media that "we are now in the stage of discussions to finalize the plan to defeat Hamas in Gaza."

Meanwhile, anxious families of Israeli hostages called for a "nationwide day of stoppage" in Israel on Sunday to express growing frustration over 22 months of war.

Families of hostages fear the coming offensive further endangers the 50 hostages remaining in Gaza, just 20 of them thought to still be alive. They and other Israelis were horrified by the recent release of videos showing emaciated hostages speaking under duress and pleading for help and food.

The families and supporters have pressed the government for a deal to stop the war -- a call that some former Israeli army and intelligence chiefs have made as well in recent weeks.

Pakistan's monsoon flooding death toll rises to 220 as forecasters warn of more rain to come

BUNER, Pakistan (AP) -- Flooding in a northwest Pakistani district has killed at least 220 people, officials said Saturday, as rescuers pulled 63 more bodies overnight from homes flattened by flash floods and landslides, with forecasts of more rain in the coming days.

One eyewitness, who escaped the deluges in Buner, described seeing floodwaters carrying hundreds of boulders and "tons of rocks" crashing down.

Hundreds of rescue workers are still searching for survivors in Buner, one of several places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where torrential rains and cloudbursts caused massive flooding on Friday, said Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for the emergency services. Dozens of homes were swept away.

First responders have been trying to recover bodies from the worst-hit villages of Pir Baba and Malik Pura, where most of the fatalities were, said Kashif Qayyum, a deputy commissioner in Buner.

Local police officer Imtiaz Khan, who narrowly escaped the deluges, said floodwaters carrying hundreds of boulders struck and flattened homes within minutes.

Things to know about the indictment against the New Orleans mayor

NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Months before New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was set to leave office because of term limits, she has been indicted in what prosecutors allege was a yearslong scheme to conceal a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.

Prosecutors say bodyguard Jeffrey Vappie was being paid as if he was working when he and Cantrell were really alone in apartments and visiting vineyards, hiding their communication by sending encrypted messages through WhatsApp and then deleting them. Although the pair have said their relationship was strictly professional, the indictment described it as "personal and intimate."

The first female mayor in New Orleans' 300-year history has been charged with conspiracy, fraud and obstruction. Vappie was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case.

The City of New Orleans said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment and that the mayor's attorney was reviewing it.

Cantrell hasn't sent out a message on her official social media feed on X since July 15, when she said the city was experiencing historic declines in crime. She and her remaining allies have said that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials.

Thomas Edison and Henry Ford among the original snowbirds: The rich going to Florida for the winters

FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Thomas Edison and Henry Ford are famous for their innovations in electricity generation and automobiles respectively, but they were also at the forefront of a massively popular trend in Florida: Rich people from up north spending the cold winter months in the Sunshine State.

Edison first visited Fort Myers in 1885 after a doctor suggested spending time in Florida's warmer climate for health reasons, and he built a house along the Caloosahatchee River the next year. Ford made many visits to southwest Florida to see Edison and purchased the property next door in 1916.

Southwest Florida became their vacation spot, Edison and Ford Winter Estates marketing director Lisa Wilson said. Edison spent most of the year in New Jersey, while Ford lived in Michigan.

"They came down here to escape the cold like many snowbirds do today. But they worked when they were here, so it wasn't just vacation time," Wilson said.

Fort Myers was basically a group of farmers living in an abandoned military fort, using tallow lamps for light, when Edison first visited, Edison and Ford Winter Estates historian Isaac Hunter said.

100 days of Pope Leo XIV: A calm papacy that avoids polemics is coming into focus

VATICAN CITY (AP) -- When Pope Leo XIV surprised tens of thousands of young people at a recent Holy Year celebration with an impromptu popemobile romp around St. Peter's Square, it almost seemed as if some of the informal spontaneity that characterized Pope Francis' 12-year papacy had returned to the Vatican.

But the message Leo delivered that night was all his own: In seamless English, Spanish and Italian, Leo told the young people that they were the "salt of the Earth, the light of the world." He urged them to spread their hope, faith in Christ and their cries of peace wherever they go.

As Robert Prevost marks his 100th day as Pope Leo this weekend, the contours of his pontificate have begun to come into relief, primarily where he shows continuity with Francis and where he signals change. Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that after 12 sometimes turbulent years under Francis, a certain calm and reserve have returned to the papacy.

Leo seems eager above all to avoid polemics or making the papacy about himself, and wants instead to focus on Christ and peace.

That seems exactly what many Catholic faithful want, and may respond to what today's church needs.

Government forces Air Canada and flight attendants back to work and into arbitration

TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's government forced Air Canada and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration Saturday after a work stoppage stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season.

Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu said now is not the time to take risks with the economy, noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. The intervention means the 10,000 flight attendants will return to work soon.

The government's action came less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job.

"The talks broke down. It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator," Hajdu said.

Hajdu said the full resumption of services could take days, noting it is up to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. Meanwhile, Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of the CUPE union, accused the government of violating the flight attendants' constitutional right to strike -- and decried Hajdu for only waiting hours to intervene.


5. Pakistan's Ashab Irfan qualifies for Jones Creek Open final

KARACHI: Pakistani squash player Ashab Irfan on Sunday qualified for the final of the ongoing Jones Creek Open Squash in the United States, while compatriot Asim Khan was ousted in the semi-finals.

In the semi-final clash of the $12,000 prize-money event, Ashab defeated Brazil's Diogo Gobbi 3-1 in a 53-minute encounter, winning the games 11-7, 14-12, 4-11, and 11-5.

Meanwhile, top-seed Asim suffered a surprise defeat against Malaysia's Nathan Chua, losing 3-1 with scores of 11-9, 4-11, 11-7, and 11-9.

Earlier on Saturday, both Pakistani players had delivered impressive performances to reach the semi-finals.

Asim overcame Egypt's Omar El Kattan 3-1 in a 46-minute quarterfinal, with game scores of 10-12, 11-3, 11-3, 13-11.

Ashab dominated Mexico's Cesar Segundo 3-0 in his quarterfinal, winning 11-3, 11-8, 11-3.

Both players had also secured their quarterfinal berths with strong second-round performances on Thursday.

Top-seed Asim defeated Egypt's Kareem Badawi 3-1 in 45 minutes (11-3, 11-6, 5-11, 11-8), while second-seed Ashab Irfan dismantled American Christopher Gordon in just 20 minutes (11-2, 11-4, 11-4), showcasing aggressive shot-making and high-paced play.

Meanwhile, Pakistan's Ahsan Ayaz and Muhammad Huzaifa Ibrahim were eliminated earlier. Seventh-seed Ahsan lost a five-game thriller against Omar El Kattan, falling 11-4, 10-12, 9-11, 11-8, 8-11 in 58 minutes.

Huzaifa bowed out in the round of 16, defeated by Brazil's third-seed Diego Gobbi 9-11, 11-3, 11-4, 11-6 in 47 minutes, despite winning the opening game.


6. Russia, Ukraine launch drones before Zelensky-Trump summit | THE DAILY TRIBUNE | KINGDOM OF BAHRAIN

AFP |Kyiv, Ukraine

Email : editor@newsofbahrain.com

Kyiv and Moscow launched attack drones at each other Sunday, a day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due in the United States for talks with President Donald Trump on ending three years of war with Russia.

Fighting has continued to rage during a flurry of diplomatic moves to end Moscow's invasion.

Kyiv's air force said Russia attacked Ukraine with 60 Iranian-made Shahed and other drones as well as an Iskander missile.

The governor of the embattled eastern Donetsk region, Vadym Filashkin, said Russian attacks killed five people in the area on Saturday.

In Russia, the defence ministry said Kyiv launched 46 drones at the country, mostly over border regions but also over the Nizhny Novgorod region east of Moscow, hundreds of kilometres from Ukraine.

The acting governor of the border Kursk region, Alexander Khinstein, said a Ukrainian drone attack killed a man in his car.

The governor of the southern Voronezh region, Alexander Gusev, said a railway worker was wounded by a drone in the region.

Ukraine has launched drones into Russia throughout Moscow's full-scale offensive, which has killed thousands of people and displaced millions.

Zelensky is due in Washington on Monday, three days after Trump hosted Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska for talks.

Following the Putin meeting, Trump dropped his push for a ceasefire in Ukraine in favour of pursuing a peace deal -- a position that Moscow has been pushing for.

Putin launched the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and Moscow's forces now occupy large swathes of the south and east of the country.


7. A terror tag and a diplomatic turn

US terror listing of BLA & Majeed Brigade marks a major win for Pakistan with regional ripples

Just days before President Donald Trump's inauguration for the second term, a senior Pakistani diplomat briefed a group of people including experts and journalists in Islamabad. His focus was on the Pakistan-US relationship under Trump's administration. The bottom line was: Pakistan should be prepared for a tough challenge.

According to the diplomat, Trump's team was surrounded by people who had little sympathy for Pakistan. Experts and those who understand Trump as well as the nature of Pakistan-US ties echoed similar sentiments. There was consensus that despite the unpredictable nature of Trump, there was little or no room for better prospects of Pakistan-US ties. On the contrary, everyone agreed that the relationship between the US and India would only deepen under President Trump's second term.

But when President Trump delivered a maiden address to the US Congress, he praised Pakistan. This was some achievement given that until then he spared no one. He launched a diatribe both against friends and foes. Pakistan was the only exception, which Trump mentioned in a positive way.

His praise stemmed from Pakistan's assistance in arresting one of the key masterminds of the Abbey Gate bombing in Kabul in August 2021. Muhammad Sharifullah, one of the ISIS-Khorasan operatives and according to the US was one of the facilitators of Kabul Airport attack, was apprehended on the intelligence provided by the CIA and swiftly handed over to the US.

That cooperation not only earned Pakistan praise from Trump but also opened a channel of communication that would eventually lead to Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir being invited to launch at the White House in an unprecedented turn of events.

When Trump applauded Pakistan at the US Congress, people were still sceptical that this bonhomie would be short-lived as Trump cannot be trusted. Questions were raised about what Pakistan had offered or was going to offer to the US in return for this cozying up approach of the US? Many people also wonder whether Pakistan would get anything in return. But what happened over the past few weeks following high-level exchanges and frequent interactions between the two countries was that Trump's praise was not mere rhetoric but now reflecting a shift in the US policy.

The substantive outcome of Pakistan helping Trump to advance his domestic agenda by arresting Abbey Gate bombing facilitator was the US State Department's move to declare Balochistan Liberation Army and its suicide squad Majeed Brigade as terrorist outfit. The designation of BLA and the Majeed Brigade, as Foreign Terrorist Organisations (FTO), was a major victory for Pakistan.

Islamabad had long sought its listing but with little success. The US declared Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist outfit but successive US administrations refrained from taking a similar stance against groups active in Balochistan. One of the reasons included that such groups including BLA and Majeed Brigade were targeting not just the Pakistani interests but also primarily the Chinese interests in the resource-rich Balochistan province.

This in many ways probably served the agendas of those who don't want China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to succeed. That was the reason the US decision was extraordinary.

The United States not only listed BLA and Majeed Brigade but also seems to be ready to extend cooperation to Pakistan to fight them. The two countries held counterterrorism dialogue, a regular feature, in Islamabad recently. The noticeable change was that for the first time BLA made it to the joint statement.

Both delegations underscored the "critical importance" of developing effective approaches to terrorist threats, singling out the BLA alongside transnational outfits. Washington lauded Islamabad's "continued successes" in containing entities that threaten regional and global peace. Therefore, listing of BLA and Majeed Brigade is a development that carries legal, political, diplomatic, and operational implications for Pakistan, the US, and even India.

First, any BLA or Majeed Brigade funds or property in the US jurisdiction are now frozen. Members and affiliates are barred from entering the US. Providing material support to the group is now a serious US federal crime, even for individuals outside the US if they have US connections. The designation makes it harder for BLA to raise funds internationally through charities, front companies, or sympathetic diaspora groups.

The FTO tag makes it riskier for members to travel abroad or seek asylum in countries aligned with US counterterrorism policies. The US can now more actively share intelligence with Pakistan and allies to track, disrupt, or eliminate the group's cells. Diaspora-based sympathisers in the West could face monitoring and prosecution. If BLA finds safe havens in neighbouring states including Afghanistan, the US listing pressures those governments to take action or face reputational costs.

While the designation won't end the insurgency, it can weaken its external support structure, especially for high-profile suicide attacks like those by the Majeed Brigade.

Second, Pakistan has long stated that BLA is a foreign-backed terrorist group responsible for attacks in Balochistan. The US designation is an international endorsement of that position.

Third, India has openly supported Baloch separatists. The US move signals that Washington is not aligning with New Delhi on this issue.

Fourth, this listing highlights a warming security relationship between Pakistan and the US.

Fifth, quietly, this could create discomfort in New Delhi if US counterterrorism measures start exposing any Indian contacts with Baloch separatists. It is not said publicly but the US move could also be linked to its keen interest in the untapped mines and minerals resources available in abundance in Balochistan. But security is a major challenge.

Some view the US interest in mines and minerals with suspicion. The view, nevertheless, in official Pakistani circles is that the US investment in Balochistan could stabilise the situation and it may lay the bases for long-term cooperation between the two countries. The listing of BLA and Majeed Brigade is being seen in that context.


8. Drone Attacks Between Kyiv and Moscow Ahead of Zelensky's Meeting with Trump

Fighting continues as diplomatic efforts attempt to bring an end to Moscow's invasion.

Kyiv and Moscow exchanged drone attacks a day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to arrive in the United States for talks with President Donald Trump aimed at ending the three-year war with Russia, AFP reported.

Fighting continues as diplomatic efforts attempt to bring an end to Moscow's invasion.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia attacked the country with 60 Iranian "Shahed" drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as an "Iskander" missile.

The governor of the besieged eastern Donetsk region, Vadym Filashkin, stated that the Russian attacks killed five people in the area.

In Russia, the Ministry of Defense reported that Kyiv launched 46 drones, mainly over border regions but also over Nizhny Novgorod, hundreds of kilometers east of Ukraine.

Acting governor of the border Kursk region, Alexander Khinshtein, said that a Ukrainian drone attack killed a man in his car.

Governor of the southern Voronezh region, Alexander Gusev, added that a railway worker was injured by a drone in the region.

Ukraine has been using drones against Russia throughout Moscow's large-scale offensive, which has caused thousands of deaths and forced millions of people to flee their homes.

Zelensky is expected in Washington three days after Trump hosted Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska for talks.

After the meeting with Putin, Trump abandoned calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine and redirected his efforts toward a peace agreement -- a position that Moscow has long advocated.

9. Fired by Elon Musk, ex-Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal launches AI startup, Deep Research API | Mint

Ex-Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal launched a new artificial intelligence (AI) startup named 'Deep Research API' in efforts to take over ChatGPT in the world AI development race.

Former Chief Executive Officer of Twitter (now known as X), Parag Agrawal, in a social media post announced that he has launched a new artificial intelligence (AI) startup named 'Deep Research API' in efforts to take over ChatGPT in the world AI development race.

In the post, Agrawal said that the first goal of the company is to 'outperform' both humans and all leading models including GPT-5 from Open AI. He also called the target two of the hardest benchmarks to beat in the industry.

"We launched our Deep Research API - it's the first to outperform both humans and all leading models including GPT-5 on two of the hardest benchmarks," said Agrawal in his post on LinkedIn.

Parag Agrawal is also the founder of the AI startup, Parallel Web Systems Inc., which is based in Palo Alto, California, United States. He said that the company offers automation facilities which companies use to carry out traditionally-human workflows with 'exceeding human-level accuracy.

"We already power millions of research tasks every day, across ambitious startups and public enterprises," said Agrawal in his post.

Agrawal started out his career as a Researcher at Microsoft in 2006, and after a few months, he shifted to the same position at Yahoo. In 2009, he again returned to Microsoft Corp.; however, after a brief run with the company, he joined the US-based telecom giant, AT&T.

In October 2011, Agrawal finally joined Twitter as a Distinguished Software Engineer and after serving for over six years, he became the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the global giant.

After spending over four years as the company's CTO, Parag Agrawal was promoted to the CEO role in November 2021.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Parag Agrawal was from the Atomic Energy Central School in India, and later finished his graduation from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a Bachelor's in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.

Agrawal in 2005 finished his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer Science from the Stanford University in United States.


10. US Carbon Emissions Jump 4.2% in 2025, Surpassing China's Decline

In a striking reversal of long-term trends, the United States has seen its carbon emissions climb in the first half of 2025, while China's have declined, marking a pivotal moment in global climate dynamics. Data from Carbon Monitor, an international scientific initiative tracking real-time emissions, shows U.S. CO2 output rose by 4.2% compared to the same period in 2024, driven largely by a resurgence in coal-fired power generation. Meanwhile, China's emissions dropped 2.7%, fueled by aggressive renewable energy expansion and favorable weather patterns that reduced coal dependency.

This shift challenges assumptions about the world's top polluters, with the U.S. potentially reclaiming its position as the leading emitter if trends persist. Analysts point to domestic factors in the U.S., including increased electricity demand from data centers and electric vehicles, which have strained grids and prompted utilities to lean on existing coal plants. According to a report in E&E News by POLITICO, coal generation in the U.S. jumped 14% in the first half of the year, reversing years of decline.

Coal's Unexpected Comeback in America

Europe, too, experienced a 4.6% emissions increase, attributed to its rapid decarbonization efforts backfiring amid energy supply disruptions. In contrast, India's emissions fell 2.2%, thanks to a boom in wind and solar power, which now make up 14% of its energy mix, up from 11% last year, as noted by the International Energy Agency. Weather played a role here, with an early monsoon cooling temperatures and curbing coal use, though the IEA forecasts a rebound later in 2025.

On the policy front, the U.S. withdrawal from international climate accords under previous administrations has left it vulnerable, while China's commitments under its 14th Five-Year Plan appear to be paying off. Posts on X highlight growing sentiment that China's green tech dominance -- evident in its electric vehicle and solar sectors -- could see it peak emissions ahead of schedule, potentially by 2025, outpacing sluggish U.S. transitions.

China's Renewable Surge and Economic Drivers

Delving deeper, China's decline stems from a massive scale-up in clean energy. The country added photovoltaic capacity to 890 GW and wind to 520 GW in 2024 alone, reducing energy storage costs to $66 per kWh, as discussed in analyses on X and corroborated by the Climate Action Tracker. This has not only cut emissions but also boosted economic growth, with clean tech sectors contributing over 10% to GDP, reaching $1.9 trillion in investments and sales.

Conversely, U.S. emissions growth underscores challenges in infrastructure. A piece in The Energy Mix details how rising fossil gas use and coal revivals undermine net-zero goals, even as renewables expand. Industry insiders note that without accelerated grid modernization and policy incentives like those in the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. risks falling further behind.

Global Implications for Energy Markets

Looking ahead, this divergence could reshape international climate negotiations, especially at COP30, where China has pledged an updated Nationally Determined Contribution by 2035. Experts from the World Economic Forum, in their Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2025 report, rank China 12th globally for its clean energy leadership, highlighting its electricity emissions hitting record lows.

For energy executives and policymakers, the takeaway is clear: China's model of state-driven renewable deployment offers lessons in scalability, while the U.S. must address demand-side pressures. As one X post from energy analysts observed, if U.S. coal use continues rising as projected by the IEA -- potentially up overall in 2025 -- global emissions trajectories may hinge more on Beijing than Washington. This shift not only alters pollution patterns but signals a reordering of economic power in the clean energy era, urging swift adaptations across sectors.

1. [Finlight] Israelis Join Nationwide Rallies to Call for Release of Hostages

Thousands of Israelis on Sunday joined rallies and a nationwide strike calling for the government to reach an immediate truce with Hamas to free hostages held in Gaza.

The day of protest came as Israeli forces geared up to expand their offensive throughout the Palestinian enclave, despite widespread international condemnation.

Families of the captives, along with their supporters, blocked several major roadways, waving Israeli flags and bearing signs featuring the hostages‚Äô photographs. At least 32 people had been detained for disrupting public order by early afternoon, according to the Israeli police.

It was unclear how many people would join the planned day of action, which was expected to culminate with a large evening protest. The country‚Äôs largest labor association, the Histadrut, has declined to throw its weight behind the strike. And while some universities said they would participate, the work stoppage falls during the academic summer break, blunting its impact.


2. [Finlight] Syria‚Äôs al-Sharaa calls for unity, accuses Israel of fuelling unrest in south

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks during a joint press conference with French President after a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on May 7, 2025.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has said the battle to unify his country after years of civil war "should not be with blood", rejecting any partition and accusing Israel of meddling in the south.

His remarks, released by state TV on Sunday, came as hundreds demonstrated in south Syria's Sweida province, denouncing sectarian violence last month and calling for the right to self-determination for the Druze-majority province.

"We still have another battle ahead of us to unify Syria, and it should not be with blood and military force... it should be through some kind of understanding because Syria is tired of war," Sharaa said during a dialogue session involving notables from the northwest province of Idlib and other senior officials.

"I do not see Syria as at risk of division. Some people desire a process of dividing Syria and trying to establish cantons... this matter is impossible," he said according to a recording of the meeting, distributed overnight by state media.

"Some parties seek to gain power through regional power, Israel or others. This is also extremely difficult and cannot be implemented," he said.

At the protest in Sweida, some demonstrators waved the Israeli flag and called for self-determination for the region.

A week of bloodshed in Sweida began on July 13 with clashes between Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin, but rapidly escalated, drawing in government forces, with Israel also carrying out strikes.

Syrian authorities have said their forces intervened to stop the clashes, but witnesses, Druze factions and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have accused them of siding with the Bedouin and committing abuses against the Druze, including summary executions.

Sharaa said that Sweida "witnessed many violations from all sides... some members of the security forces and army in Syria also carried out some violations".

The state is required "to hold all perpetrators of violations to account", whatever their affiliation, he added.

"Israel is intervening directly in Sweida, seeking to implement policies aimed at weakening the state in general or finding excuses to interfere in ongoing policies in the southern region," Sharaa said.

Israel, which has its own Druze community, has said it has acted to defend the minority group as well as enforce its demands for the demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Syria's new authorities are also in talks with a semi-autonomous Kurdish administration that runs swathes of the country's north and northeast and has called for decentralisation, which Damascus has rejected.

Implementation of a March 10 deal on integrating the Kurds' semi-autonomous civil and military institutions into the state has been held up by differences between the parties.

"We are now discussing the mechanisms for implementation" of the deal, Sharaa said.

3. [Finlight] Want more productivity, Rachel Reeves? It‚Äôs time to embrace Mancunian swagger | Richard Partington

Over the summer Rachel Reeves has been on a road trip around Britain. From Cornwall and Kent, to Aberdeen, south Wales and Belfast, in search of the solutions for a national economy that is stuck in a rut.

Inspired by this tour, the chancellor used a Guardian article last week to set her autumn budget priority: boosting productivity. Tax and spending may dominate news headlines, but this is the real problem facing the country, and no politician of the past two decades has managed to fix it.

Productivity is a dull word of vital importance. Growing the measure of output for each hour of work is an economic secret sauce, enabling growth in wages and living standards over the long-run without stoking inflation.

On the hunt for solutions, Reeves could have extended her trip. Leaving Westminster on a (most probably delayed) Avanti train from Euston, or an overcrowded TransPennine Express from her Leeds constituency; for the wetter side of northern England, where Manchester is having a moment in the sun.

Unlike the rest of Britain, there are signs of life in Greater Manchester‚Äôs productivity. Between 2004 and 2023, the city region recorded the highest rise in gross value added for each hour worked of any combined authority in the country.

London ‚Äì once the driver of UK growth ‚Äì has effectively stalled. The capital is still streets ahead in terms of productivity and the UK is still one of the most regionally unequal countries in Europe, with no regions outside London and the south-east of England above the national average. But Manchester is beginning to close the gap ‚Äì with growth of 31% since 2004.

To anyone familiar with the north-west, this will probably come as no surprise. Manchester has changed beyond all recognition in recent years, never mind the past two decades. The Ha√ßienda has been a posh block of flats for longer than it was at the epicentre of the ‚ÄúMadchester‚Äù music scene. The class of ‚Äò92 swapped Old Trafford for building luxury hotels long ago, petrodollar cash has flooded the east of the city, and Oasis have just added, by some counts, ¬£1bn to the British economy at large.

‚ÄúManchester has got this buzz about it,‚Äù says Jim O‚ÄôNeill, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist, and a proud Mancunian, who now chairs the Northern Powerhouse Partnership.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been there for years in the [city] centre. But most importantly it‚Äôs now spreading. Some would say it‚Äôs that Manchester swagger. It all relates to an attitude that ‚Äòwe can do this; we want to see it happen‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know another part of the country where it has that vibe.‚Äù

For years Britain‚Äôs productivity growth has been a dismal disappointment. Before the 2008 financial crisis growth averaged 2% a year, but has trickled to well below 1% since. Figures last week showed growth contracted in the year to June.

With the autumn budget not far off, this is fuelling a sense of alarm in the Treasury. Whitehall is abuzz with speculation that the Office for Budget Responsibility is poised to hand Reeves downgraded productivity forecasts ‚Äì with the potential to blow a ¬£20bn hole in her tax and spending plans.

To turn things around, Reeves could take the ingredients behind Manchester‚Äôs renaissance and apply them elsewhere. She could also double down on the ‚ÄúNorthern Powerhouse‚Äù strategy for good measure.

Sources close to Labour say that is exactly the plan: Keir Starmer and Reeves are expected to launch an intensified regional growth strategy next month, with the revival of the Northern Powerhouse Rail project as its centrepiece.

Those who know Manchester best say there are a few golden threads to the renaissance of Cottonopolis: devolution; political stability and coordination between its policymakers, businesses and institutions; the involvement of its top universities; and sustained investment.

Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, says London hasn‚Äôt entirely cottoned on. The city symbolised by the worker bee has done well, but could have done even more with extra money and power from the Treasury.

‚ÄúThe learning for Whitehall is, if you want productivity growth, and growth more broadly, you have to let go and trust places. And you have to invest. Because you can‚Äôt get it without investment.

‚Äú[But] there is a bias against cities outside London and the south, and as long as this remains, the country will not achieve its full potential.‚Äù

‚ÄúI compare Manchester [today] with the city I came back to after uni, and the one I had to leave to get on in life. It‚Äôs been a major shift. The momentum is there now, and it‚Äôs what you do with that next.‚Äù

In truth the Manchester revival has deep roots. The timeline before Burnham‚Äôs arrival as mayor in 2017 is well known: the 1996 IRA bomb as catalyst for city centre regeneration; the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the opening of Salford Media City, the Lowry, Bridgewater Hall and the expansion of the Metrolink.

Led by the city council‚Äôs former chief executive, Howard Bernstein, and leader, Richard Leese, their ‚ÄúManchester family‚Äù approach to coordinating investment proves Reeves‚Äôs theory that public money can ‚Äúcrowd in‚Äù the private sector : Manchester has ranked top outside London for foreign direct investment projects for three of the past five years.

However, the transformation isn‚Äôt all plain sailing. House prices and rents are rocketing, crowding out families from Manchester‚Äôs poorer suburbs. For those who, like me, grew up around these parts, the skyscraper-sprouting skyline is a source of both pride, but also nagging worry. Could the pace of change sweep away something special, in a city used to doing things differently? And are the proceeds of growth lining Mancunian pockets, or flowing out of the Irwell to an offshore bank account?

Burnham is alive to the danger. ‚ÄúI use the phrase that, the kids can see the skyscrapers from their bedroom window but they currently don‚Äôt see a path to the modern Greater Manchester economy. The next phase is about making that path.‚Äù

Still, the addition of glass-fronted flats and office blocks among the converted Victorian mills has helped Manchester to create more jobs at a faster pace than the UK average. They reflect Labour‚Äôs hopes for Britain more broadly: that a fairer distribution of growth, in theory, will become easier if there is some growth in the first place.

Reeves could do with a few more Mancunian economic miracles. The national economy will not come unstuck without Britain‚Äôs biggest regional cities reaching their full productive potential.

In her first conference speech as chancellor last year, along the M62 in Liverpool, Reeves promised a Labour government would mean ‚Äúshovels in the ground. Cranes in the sky. The sounds and the sights of the future arriving.‚Äù

To the next critic who asks when exactly that will come about, a Manchester reference may help.


4. [Finlight] Rayner says Farage ‚Äòfailing young women‚Äô with plan to scrap Online Safety Act

Nigel Farage is ‚Äúfailing a generation of young women‚Äù with his plans to scrap the Online Safety Act, Angela Rayner has said, arguing the move would cause an increase in the prevalence of ‚Äúrevenge porn‚Äù.

The comments by the deputy prime minister are the latest criticism of Farage from the government, with Labour launching a parallel series of attack adverts on the Reform UK leader, including one showing him alongside the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate.

In a press conference at the end of last month, Reform promised to scrap the act, which had just come into force, saying measures intended to push social media companies to limit false and potentially harmful content would instead bring censorship and make the UK ‚Äúa borderline dystopian state‚Äù.

In response, the science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, accused Farage of being on the side of child abusers such as Jimmy Savile, bringing a furious response from the Reform leader.

In comments to the Sunday Telegraph, Rayner highlighted what she said would be the risks of getting rid of the act in terms of clamping down on what is formally known as intimate image abuse, where offenders either upload intimate pictures or footage of others or else share them via other means.

‚ÄúIntimate image abuse is a devastating crime and contributes to a vile misogynistic culture on social media that we know translates into physical spaces too,‚Äù Rayner told the paper.

‚ÄúNigel Farage risks failing a generation of young women with his dangerous and irresponsible plans to scrap online safety laws. Scrapping safeguards and having no viable alternative plan in place to halt the floodgates of abuse that could open is an appalling dereliction of duty.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Farage to tell women and girls across Britain how he would keep them safe online.‚Äù

Labour is launching a linked series of online adverts against Farage, including one published on Sunday morning connected to Rayner‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúNigel Farage wants to make it easier to share revenge porn online,‚Äù it says, alongside an image of Farage grinning.

According to the Sunday Times, another advert will highlight Farage‚Äôs comments about Tate, the influencer who, along with his brother, Tristan, faces charges in the UK including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.

The two British Americans are under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges that they deny.

The Labour advert shows Farage with Andrew Tate and the headline: ‚ÄúNigel Farage says Andrew Tate is an ‚Äòimportant voice‚Äô for men.‚Äù The comments come from an interview Farage did on the Strike It Big podcast last year.

Laila Cunningham, a former magistrate who has joined Reform, wrote a Telegraph article on Saturday in which she called the Online Safety Act ‚Äúcensorship laws‚Äù, saying laws already existed to combat ‚Äùrevenge porn‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cover for censorship, and an excuse to hand unelected regulators sweeping powers to silence views they don‚Äôt like, while doing nothing about the real crimes happening on our streets,‚Äù she wrote.

Cunningham said minister should instead focus on detaining asylum seekers rather than putting them in hotels, saying that for now, women ‚Äúare being put in harm‚Äôs way‚Äù as the asylum seekers could pose a risk to them.

7. [Finlight] Will Trump‚Äôs tariffs get ‚Äôtariffried‚Äô by the courts?

Investing.com --¬†The Trump administration is bracing for a potential legal setback that could undermine its tariff strategy, analysts at Yardeni Research highlighted in a note this week.¬†
The firm stated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., may soon rule that President Donald Trump lacks the legal authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
Yardeni noted that concern was evident in an August 11 letter from two of the administration‚Äôs top lawyers to the court clerk, filed after oral arguments on July 31, where judges reportedly pressed the government on the tariffs‚Äô legality.¬†
The letter warns that ‚Äúsuddenly revoking the President‚Äôs tariff authority under IEEPA would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,‚Äù adding it could ‚Äúlead to a 1929-style result.‚Äù
While Yardeni said the conclusion ‚Äúmay be exaggerated,‚Äù the fallout would still be ‚Äúmessy,‚Äù with foreign governments potentially ignoring trade agreements and companies seeking tariff refunds from the Treasury.
Trump has promoted tariffs as an ‚ÄúExternal Revenue Service‚Äù to help cut the federal deficit.¬†
Customs duties hit a record $157 billion over the 12 months through July, and Trump has aimed for a base tariff of 10%-15% on all U.S. trading partners, potentially yielding over $500 billion annually.
Losing the case could raise bond yields and pressure stocks due to renewed policy uncertainty, according to Yardeni.
The firm cited Capital Alpha Partners‚Äô Jim Lucier, who expects a Federal Circuit decision by late August or September.
¬†A unanimous ruling against the administration could give the Supreme Court cover to avoid the case and decline a stay that would keep the tariffs in place.


8. [Finlight] Wells Fargo outlines how the Fed may revisit its policy framework at Jackson Hole

Investing.com -¬†Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to go over how the U.S. economy and the central bank‚Äôs policy setting has evolved over the course of his tenure at a closely-watched event in Wyoming later this month, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.
Powell previously used his address at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in 2020 to lay out changes to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs policy framework. Some five years later, that outline is now set to reach its conclusion.
In a note, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Sarah House noted that in the decade leading up to the FOMC‚Äôs prior framework review, the economic environment was dominated by persistently low inflation and excess labor market slack. The Fed has been tasked with using its policies options to keep inflation stable and securing maximum employment.¬†
"The adjustments made in 2020 at the height of the pandemic reflected these perceived asymmetric risks to the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate," the analysts wrote.
However, in the time since then, the macroeconomic backdrop has changed drastically. Powered by pandemic-era shocks, inflation charged past 2% in March 2021 and has not returned to that rate -- the Fed‚Äôs target level -- since. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to less than 4% by the end of that same year. It now stands at 4.2%.
"Much of the past few years have been marked by U.S. monetary policymakers facing an old but new problem: overheated labor markets and above-target inflation," the analysts wrote.
Against this backdrop, they do not anticipate that the Fed will unveil any major changes to its toolkit as part of this year‚Äôs review, with the key federal funds rate likely to stay the main device the central bank can utilize to respond to broader trends in employment and inflation.
The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet may also be "de-emphasized" as a policy tool "for the time being," they added. Powell is anticipated to review how the FOMC approaches policy communication later this year as well.
Generally, the strategists said the new framework will likely "codify" what is already the Fed‚Äôs "modus operandi" -- a more "symmetric" approach to its inflation and employment objectives.
"Yet, the shift away from the asymmetric risks around low inflation and maximum employment marks an important departure from the psychology of the 2008-2020 period, and it could result in more preemptive policy tightening when the next inflationary episode occurs," they said.

10. [Finlight] UAE: What are Certificates of Origin and how Abu Dhabi‚Äôs 10.3% rise proves a shift from oil dependence

Certificates of Origin certify that goods are produced in a specific country, essential for customs, tariffs, and export compliance/ Image: File

Certificates of Origin: Their role and relevance

Growth in COO issuance reflects rising export momentum





Strategic implications for Abu Dhabi‚Äôs economy

Institutional role of the Abu Dhabi Chamber





The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported a significant increase in the issuance of Certificates of Origin over the past year. This development highlights the emirate‚Äôs growing industrial base, increased trade activity, and a steadily advancing economic diversification strategy aimed at reducing dependence on oil exports.A Certificate of Origin (COO) serves as an official document confirming that the goods in a shipment are wholly obtained, produced, manufactured, or processed in a specific country. These certificates are vital tools in international trade, helping businesses clear customs, determine applicable tariffs, and comply with import regulations in target markets.In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, a valid COO is often mandatory for both exports and imports. Without it, companies risk facing shipment delays, regulatory penalties, or outright rejection of goods. In this context, chambers of commerce, such as the one in Abu Dhabi, play a central role, acting as accredited bodies authorised to issue these certificates.Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Abu Dhabi Chamber recorded a 10.3 percent increase in the number of COOs issued. This growth signals a wider and more active base of local exporters, as well as heightened economic activity across non-oil sectors.The Chamber attributes this uptick to Abu Dhabi‚Äôs expanding industrial capacity and its growing reputation as a key regional player in trade and investment.Sectorally, the bulk of these COOs were issued to businesses involved in chemicals, metals, and engineering ‚Äî all areas that point to a robust and diversified manufacturing ecosystem. Notably, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have shown increased participation in export activities, driven by support mechanisms provided by the Chamber. These include specialised training programs, business matchmaking efforts, and collaboration with regional and international trade entities.The broader export landscape also aligns with these trends. During the first half of 2025, Abu Dhabi‚Äôs non-oil foreign trade surged by 34.7 percent. Within that, non-oil exports leapt by 64 percent, re-exports grew by 35 percent, and imports rose by 15 percent. These figures build on the previous year‚Äôs performance, which also saw strong growth: non-oil trade rose by 9 percent, exports increased by 16 percent, and imports by 3 percent.The increasing number of Certificates of Origin being issued by the Abu Dhabi Chamber is seen by its leadership as a strong indicator of export sector vitality and a reflection of the emirate‚Äôs deepening integration with global trade networks. Shamis Al Dhaheri, Second Vice Chairman and Managing Director of the Chamber, considers this sustained rise as clear proof of the competitiveness of Abu Dhabi-based companies and their growing capacity to enter and thrive in international markets.Al Dhaheri has attributed this momentum not only to market confidence in locally produced goods but also to the Chamber‚Äôs continued investment in supporting export-ready businesses. He noted that Abu Dhabi companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, are increasingly leveraging the Chamber‚Äôs services, including export training, market access programs, and strategic trade partnerships, to expand their global footprint.He also emphasized that the Chamber is focused on enabling exporters to benefit from customs advantages provided by bilateral and multilateral agreements. With COOs validating the national origin of goods, UAE products are better positioned to benefit from preferential trade terms, giving them a more competitive edge in international markets.According to him, the Chamber views Certificates of Origin as more than just administrative tools; they are gateways to new economic opportunities. He pointed to the Chamber‚Äôs ongoing efforts to enhance its digital infrastructure and to advocate for the private sector as part of a broader strategy to make Abu Dhabi‚Äôs economy more resilient and globally connected.Al Dhaheri underlined that the current indicators affirm not just the strength of the Chamber‚Äôs services, but also the private sector‚Äôs rising contribution to national economic goals. The increase in export activity, particularly among SMEs, is seen as a tangible outcome of the emirate‚Äôs diversification agenda and its efforts to reduce dependency on oil revenues.Founded in 1969 by an Emiri decree issued by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established to promote and protect the interests of businesses operating in the emirate. Over the decades, it has evolved into a central platform for dialogue between the private sector and the government, supporting enterprise development across sectors.The Chamber hosts frequent trade delegations, policy discussions, and cross-border business forums. These activities help reinforce Abu Dhabi‚Äôs global standing and attract foreign direct investment. Recognised by the leadership and business community alike, the Chamber‚Äôs programs serve as key enablers of the emirate‚Äôs economic ambitions.In line with this mission, the Chamber continues to invest in improving its digital infrastructure and expanding its export-related services. It views the recent growth in COOs not just as a positive trade indicator, but as a sign of resilience, adaptability, and growing maturity within Abu Dhabi‚Äôs private sector.


üíª TECHNOLOGY HIGHLIGHTS

1. Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems - SiliconANGLE

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world."

China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40% compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce.

Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10% of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9% year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.

To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q&A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing.

"Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

During discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade.

Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model.

"The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes.

At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms.

The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for overseas market.

Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba.

As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.
