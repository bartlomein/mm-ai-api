2. The Most Common Red Flags Found In Property Ownership Records

Successful investors and other real estate professionals rely heavily on data to guide their decisions.

Real estate investing is often described as a pathway to financial freedom, but it's not without its risks. Unfortunately, not every property is the golden opportunity it appears to be on paper or during a walk-through. Hidden problems, such as unpaid taxes, legal issues, and costly repairs, can quickly turn a promising investment into a financial drain. That's why successful investors and other real estate professionals rely heavily on data to guide their decisions.

By researching historical ownership records, tax information, permit history, and more, you can uncover red flags before you sign on the dotted line. PropertyReach shares what you need to know about the biggest property record red flags real estate investors might encounter and which data insights can help you spot them early.

Even if you fall in love with a property's location, layout, or potential, or you recognize the value it can offer as a great flip or investment, you don't want to jump in without deeper insights. Without proper investigation, you could be stepping into a situation that will cost you a lot more time and money than you expect.

It's essential to understand the most common issues that can catch investors off guard, so you can avoid them and choose the best properties for your real estate and financial goals.

Back Taxes Owed

Properties with unpaid property taxes can mean significant financial and legal complications. Approximately $22 billion in property taxes went unpaid across the U.S. in 2023. Tax liens can take priority over other debts and have to be paid before ownership is transferred. If you don't discover these in advance, you could be responsible for thousands of dollars in delinquent taxes after closing.

Frequent Ownership Change

A high turnover rate in ownership can signal red flags. Was the property flipped multiple times in a short period? Have previous owners defaulted on loans or abandoned it? Frequent changes might indicate structural problems, poor location, or a lack of market interest, so you need to find out more before taking a chance on the property.

Deferred Maintenance

A fresh coat of paint can hide a multitude of problems. Investors often discover too late that a property requires a new roof, updated electrical wiring, or a major plumbing overhaul. If maintenance has been neglected, rehab costs can quickly escalate after the purchase, so it's essential to identify any existing issues with the property before proceeding.

Title and Lien Complications

Title defects often surface during the closing of a deal. Over one-third of U.S. residential real estate transactions encounter title or lien issues that must be resolved before closing. Common problems include unpaid liens or taxes, undisclosed heirs or ownership disputes, and recording errors on deeds.

The good news is that the vast majority of these red flags are visible if you know where to look. Public records, real estate databases, and platforms offering access to detailed property histories can help you steer clear of problematic properties. This will give you more peace of mind and a better financial outcome for your next property purchase.

Ownership Records

One way to find potential problems is to look for unusual patterns in ownership. If a property has changed hands multiple times within a short period, it may suggest underlying issues. Ownership records can also help confirm the seller's legitimacy and ensure that there are no disputes over the title, like liens or estate concerns.

Property Tax Payment History

You'll want to review the property's tax records to identify missed or late payments. A consistent history of delinquencies may indicate financial distress, and any outstanding taxes must be addressed before the property can be legally transferred. You don't want to end up with a huge tax bill you weren't expecting.

Property Listings and Market Activity

If the property was listed, removed, and relisted multiple times, that could suggest issues uncovered during inspections or appraisals that caused deals to fall through. Listings can also provide insight into price reductions or market resistance, so you can track what's happening with properties in your area.

Hazard Zones

Properties in flood zones, wildfire-prone areas, or near industrial sites may face higher insurance premiums or safety risks, which can make them more challenging to flip and resell. It can also increase your costs if you intend to keep those properties as rentals. Researching environmental hazards can help you plan accordingly or walk away if the risks are too great.

Foreclosures and Short Sales

Properties with a history of foreclosure or short sales often come with a list of financial difficulties. There may be deferred maintenance, damage, or legal complications involved, so it's essential to investigate thoroughly before proceeding.

Property Characteristics

Sometimes, the actual details of the property, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and lot size, don't match what's listed. You can cross-reference tax records and past listings to verify the property's specs.

Other Data Sources

Utility histories, building violations, and neighborhood crime data can all provide valuable context. A property might look great on its own, but if it's in a declining area or associated with unresolved violations, it may not be a sound investment.

Before investing in any property, run through this checklist to ensure you've done your due diligence:

By researching these items in advance through a property and owner data platform, you can confidently move forward with your real estate investment.

When it comes to real estate, what you don't know upfront can end up completely derailing your investment. That's why thorough research is essential before purchasing any property.

Using a powerful real estate database puts everything you need in one place, from ownership history and tax records to permitting data and lien reports. With these platforms, you can uncover property record red flags early, avoid costly mistakes, and invest with clarity and confidence.

3. 'Superman' star Terence Stamp dead at 87

Terence Stamp, who is best known for his roles in the Christopher Reeve "Superman" movies and "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," has passed away. He was 87.

The beloved actor's family announced the news in a statement to Reuters on Sunday, Aug. 17.

"He leaves behind an extraordinary body of work, both as an actor and as a writer that will continue to touch and inspire people for years to come," his loved ones said. "We ask for privacy at this sad time."

Born in London in 1938, Stamp made his film debut in 1962's "Billy Budd" - a role that garnered him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globe for Most Promising Male Newcomer.

He later starred in 1966's "Modesty Blaise" and 1967's "Far from the Madding Crowd," the latter of which also included his then-girlfriend, Julie Christie.

But Stamp's opportunities appeared to dry up toward the end of the 1960s. He opened up about that time of his life during an interview with The Guardian in 2015.

"It's a mystery to me," he told the outlet. "I was in my prime. When the 1960s ended, I just ended with it."

"I remember my agent telling me: 'They are all looking for a young Terence Stamp.' And I thought: 'I am young.' I was 31, 32. I couldn't believe it," the actor added.

Stamp ultimately returned to the big screen when he was offered the role of General Zod opposite Christopher Reeve's iconic Superman in 1978's "Superman."

He would also return to the role two years later for the film's 1980 sequel.

"During that time away from the screen, I had transmuted myself," he told The Guardian 10 years before his passing. "I no longer saw myself as a leading man."

"What had happened inside of me enabled me to take the role and not feel embarrassed or depressed about playing the villain," Stamp added regarding the General Zod role. "I just decided I was a character actor now and I can do anything."

Stamp portrayed a villain once more in 1994's "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."

The film, which also starred Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce, saw Stamp play a trans woman named Bernadette who travels on a road trip with drag queens.

Stamp once again received widespread acclaim for the performance, and he was nominated for Best Actor at the 1995 Golden Globes.

"Cross-dressing has been around at least since Shakespeare," Stamp told People shortly after the release of "Priscilla" in 1994. "It would be nice if greater androgyny were the next big social development. It would make relationships easier."

"I'm sure Hollywood will say, 'We knew he was a great villain; now we know he's got great legs,'" he also joked at the time. "I live in hope."

Stamp's other impressive acting credits include "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" (1999), "Elektra" (2005), "The Adjustment Bureau" (2011) and "Murder Mystery" (2019).

"Last Night in Soho," one of Stamp's final projects before his death, was released in 2021.


4. Bangladesh Denies India's Proposal to Route Exports to the U.S. via Dhaka

*Dhaka, August 17, 2025* -- In a recently revealed policy decision, Bangladesh has turned down India's request to facilitate Indian goods' transit through Bangladesh en route to the United States. The refusal stems from mounting concerns over high U.S. tariffs that apply to re-exported Indian-origin goods, even when routed via third countries without major transformation. Background and Reasoning

Indian exporters had hoped to use Bangladesh as a corridor to reach the U.S. market, seeking relief from rising global logistic costs and sluggish demand. However, under the U.S. reciprocal tariff regime introduced in early April 2025 -- specifically Executive Order and CSMS #64680374 -- tariffs are imposed based on the *origin* of the exporter, not modified by mere transit or re-export. As a result, Indian products sent through Bangladesh without substantial transformation will still be deemed Indian-origin and subject to U.S. tariffs (Textile News link ).

Bangladesh officials also noted that the country currently lacks the necessary industrial infrastructure to perform significant transformation on Indian goods that would reclassify them as Bangladeshi origin. Investing in such capacity would require major foreign direct investment and industrial expansion, which is not yet feasible (Textile News link ). Broader Context: Trade Tensions Intensify

This development unfolds amid broader strains in Bangladesh-India trade relations:

-

In *April 2025*, India abruptly *rescinded a transshipment facility* established in 2020 that allowed Bangladesh to export goods to third countries through Indian land customs stations, ports, and airports. The decision, effective from April 8, was attributed to increasing congestion, delays, and logistical costs affecting India's export operations (The Daily Star link, Business Standard link, Dhaka Tribune link ). -

Moreover, bilateral tensions have escalated following Bangladesh's interim government head Muhammad Yunus's remarks in China -- describing Northeast India as "landlocked" and Bangladesh as its "guardian to the ocean" -- which many viewed in New Delhi as a strategic challenge (ORF Online link, The Diplomat link, India Toda link y.

Trade Impact and Economic Ramifications

The refusal to serve as a transit route to the U.S. reflects a careful economic calculation by Bangladesh. Accepting Indian-origin goods for transit would neither circumvent U.S. tariffs nor enhance Bangladesh's competitiveness; instead, it could compromise policy integrity and overextend its limited industrial-processing capabilities.

Moreover, Bangladesh's own export competitiveness is under strain due to U.S. tariff pressure -- though a relief came recently when it secured a *20% tariff* on garment exports to the U.S., reduced from the initially proposed 37%, offering much-needed support to its $40 billion apparel sector (Reuters link ). Looking Ahead: Strategic and Diplomatic Pathways

-

*Policy Balance*: Bangladesh aims to safeguard its export competitiveness while avoiding policies that may not yield tangible economic benefits. -

*Regional Trade Coordination*: Commentators and trade analysts urge both South Asian nations to prioritize structured dialogue and align trade strategies through regional platforms like BIMSTEC or BBIN to ensure smoother customs processes and resilience amid geopolitical shifts -

*Diplomatic Engagement*: With India navigating both domestic logistic concerns and geopolitical tensions, high-level bilateral talks could lay the groundwork for rebuilding economic trust and exploring conditional, restructured transit arrangements

Bangladesh has declined India's request to route exports to the U.S. through its territory, citing that such a move offers no tariff relief and lacks infrastructural viability. This decision aligns with broader regional trade tensions -- marked by India's revocation of transshipment facilities -- and highlights the intricate balance between economic pragmatism and diplomatic strategy amid evolving global tariff regimes.

8. Putin agreed to let US, Europe offer NATO-style security protections for Ukraine, Trump envoy says

Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a working meeting to discuss the results of the Russia-US summit in Alaska at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025.

Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.

"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO," he told CNN's "State of the Union." He added that it "was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that" and called them "game-changing."

Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.

Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.

Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not "go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more."

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. "We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share," she said.

Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but that much was unclear.

"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine," he said, "But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees," he said.

Witkoff defended Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which Trump had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.

"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal," Witkoff said, without elaborating. "We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal."

RELATED STORY | Ukraine's Zelenskyy to meet Trump on Monday after US-Russia summit secured no halt to fighting

Rubio, who appeared on three Sunday news shows, said there was not going to be any kind of truce reached because Ukraine was not at the summit.

"Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences," Rubio said on ABC's "This Week." "But we're trying to avoid that."

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, said he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.

"The minute you issue new sanctions, your ability to get them to the table, our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished," Rubio told NBC's "Meet the Press."

He also said "we're not at the precipice of a peace agreement" and that getting there would not be easy and would take a lot of work.

"We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off," Rubio said.

Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders, who heard from Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.

"I think everybody agreed that we had made progress. Maybe not enough for a peace deal, but we are on the path for the first time," Witkoff said.

He added: "The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians -- that could not have been discussed at this meeting" with Putin. "We intend to discuss it on Monday. Hopefully we have some clarity on it and hopefully that ends up in a peace deal very, very soon."


9. Diamondbacks select Nabil Crismatt to start vs. Rockies

The Arizona Diamondbacks have selected the contract of right-handed pitcher Nabil Crismatt from Triple-A Reno who will start Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, the team announced.

The Diamondbacks optioned pitcher Casey Kelly to Reno in a corresponding move following Saturday night's game.

The news comes as the Diamondbacks had an open spot in the rotation after placing righty Anthony DeSclafani on the 15-day injured list on Wednesday with right thumb inflammation.

Crismatt has largely been a reliever since making his MLB debut in 2020. He has spent time in and out of the majors with the St. Louis Cardinals (2020), San Diego Padres (2021-23), D-backs (2023) and Los Angles Dodgers (2024).

In 114 games pitched, Crismatt has posted a 9-6 record with a 3.71 ERA with a 162 strikeouts and 1.30 WHIP.

The D-backs wrap up their four-game series at Coors Field against the Rockies on Sunday as the Diamondbacks look to salvage a series split after losing their last two games.


10. Northern China flash flood kills 10, Xinhua reports

BEIJING - At least 10 people died in a flash flood in northern China, state media reported on Sunday, with two others still missing, as the East Asian monsoon continues to unleash atmospheric chaos across the world's second-largest economy.

The banks of a river running through the grasslands of Inner Mongolia burst at around 10 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Saturday, the report said, washing away 13 people camping on the outskirts of the city of Bayannur, a major agricultural hub.

A search and rescue operation involving more than 700 people is underway, according to state news agency Xinhua. One person has been rescued.

China has suffered weeks of extreme weather since July, battered by heavier-than-usual downpours with the monsoon stalling over its north and south.

Weather experts link the shifting pattern to climate change, testing officials as flash floods displace thousands and threaten billions of dollars in economic losses.

Bayannur is an important national grain and oil production base, as well as a sheep breeding and processing centre.

At the other end of the country, a three-and-a-half-month fishing suspension in the southern province of Hainan ended on Saturday, state media reported, after agricultural affairs officials ordered ships to shelter in port owing to persistent, heavy rain.

In the southwestern province of Sichuan, severe weather on Friday killed two people and injured three others at a beer festival in the city of Mianzhu, after a truss fell on them, according to a local police report on Saturday.

The deluge in Inner Mongolia follows a deadly downpour in Beijing - just under 1,000 km (621 miles) away - late last month which killed at least 44 people and forced the evacuation of more than 70,000 residents.

The central government announced last week 430 million yuan ($59.9 million) in fresh funding for disaster relief, taking the total allocated since April to at least 5.8 billion yuan.


11. Spain battles 20 major wildfires amid scorching heat, deploys more troops

VILLARDEV√ìS - Scorching heat hampered efforts to contain 20 major wildfires across Spain on Sunday, prompting the government to deploy an additional 500 troops from the military emergency unit to support firefighting operations.

In the northwestern region of Galicia, several fires have converged to form a large blaze, forcing the closure of highways and rail services to the region.

Southern Europe is experiencing one of its worst wildfire seasons in two decades, with Spain among the hardest-hit countries.

In the past week alone, fires there have claimed three lives and burned more than 115,000 hectares, while neighbouring Portugal also battles widespread blazes.

Temperatures are expected to reach up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some areas on Sunday, Spanish national weather agency AEMET said.

"There are still some challenging days ahead and, unfortunately, the weather is not on our side," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a news conference in Ourense, one of the most affected areas.

He announced an increase in military reinforcements, bringing the total number of troops deployed across Spain to 1,900.

Virginia Barcones, director general of emergency services, told Spanish public TV temperatures were expected to drop from Tuesday, but for now the weather conditions were "very adverse".

"Today there are extremely high temperatures with an extreme risk of fires, which complicates the firefighting efforts," Barcones said.

VILLAGERS RESORT TO BUCKETS

In the village of Villardevos in Galicia, desperate neighbours have organised to fight the flames on their own with water buckets as the area was left without electricity to power water pumps.

"The fireplanes come in from all sides, but they don't come here," Basilio Rodriguez, a resident, told Reuters on Saturday.

Added Lorea Pascual, another local resident: "It's insurmountable, it couldn't be worse".

Interior ministry data show 27 people have been arrested and 92 were under investigation for suspected arson since June.

In neighbouring Portugal, wildfires have burnt some 155,000 hectares of vegetation so far this year, according to provisional data from the ICNF forestry protection institute - three times the average for this period between 2006 to 2024. About half of that area burned just in the past three days.

Thousands of firefighters were battling eight large blazes in central and northern Portugal, the largest of them near Piodao, a scenic, mountainous area popular with tourists.

Another blaze in Trancoso, further north, has now been raging for eight days. A smaller fire a few miles east claimed a local resident's life on Friday - the first this season.


12. Pakistan Crushed Indian Arrogance In Four Hours: PA Speaker - UrduPoint

LAHORE, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 17th Aug, 2025) Speaker Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmed Khan has said that Pakistan crushed Indian arrogance within just four hours, and the world has acknowledged Pakistan's superiority over India.

He was addressing a seminar titled 'Global Impacts of Pakistan's Military and Diplomatic Victories over India', organised by the Waris Mir Foundation at Aiwan-e-Iqbal on Sunday.

Malik Ahmed Khan said the entire world is aware that Pakistan has been the biggest victim of Indian state-sponsored terrorism. He remarked that Indian rulers are obsessed with regional supremacy, but their desire has never been fulfilled. "I am not a supporter of wars, because I am not a brave man," he said, adding that India's political leadership had forgotten the horrors of war. He stressed the need for dialogue and peace in the region, even with "war-mad rulers" in India.

Referring to the Pahalgam incident, the speaker questioned who was behind the act of terrorism, while pointing out that Pakistan has concrete evidence of Indian involvement in terrorism over the last two decades. "From Kulbhushan Jadhav to RAW agents arrested in Jhelum, and Indian-backed terrorism in Balochistan, the world knows who is responsible," he said.

Pakistan, he added, had always given India a befitting reply.

He praised the Waris Mir Foundation as a progressive platform for dialogue and paid tribute to Pakistan's armed forces. "Field Marshal Hafiz Asim Munir struck enemy targets with precision and stood like a wall of steel against Indian aggression," he said, warning that any attempt to deprive Pakistan of its water rights would be foiled at all costs.

The speaker further said that after Indian aggression, Pakistan's friendly countries extended full support to its stance.

On the occasion, PPP leader Faisal Mir, addressing the seminar, said no power in the world can defeat a country whose prime minister and supreme commander (President Asif Ali Zardari) are fearless.

Renowned journalist Shahnawaz Rana presented a paper on the late Waris Mir, while souvenirs were presented by the Foundation to Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani, Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi, and Speaker Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmed Khan.

Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza and Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi also spoke on the occasion.

14. Khawar Hussain Journalist Death: Did He Take His Own Life? Latest Updates Revealed Shocking Details

Pakistani journalist Khawar Hussain found dead on Saturday night of August 16, 2025 outside of a restaurant on Hyderabad Road and Sanghar. The case of the journalist, Khawar Hussain death, has triggered the question whether it was suicide or was it a targeted killing.

According to police, Khawar Hussain was seated in the driver's seat with a pistol in his hand when discovered. CCTV footage showed the journalist Khawar Hussain entering and exiting the restaurant twice before returning to his car. No other individual was captured in the footage.

The journalist had travelled to Sanghar to attend a religious gathering at his brother-in-law's residence. The sudden death of Khawar Hussain journalist has triggered widespread concern among media workers and institutions.

Police confirmed that the weapon recovered from the car was Khawar Hussain's own licensed pistol. Investigators are treating the case under both possible angles -- suicide and homicide. Call data records (CDR), bullet casing, fingerprints, and forensic analysis are being reviewed in the Khawar Hussain journalist death investigation.

One of Khawar Hussain journalist's two mobile phones is still missing and being traced by authorities.

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Governor Kamran Tessori, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari have directed senior police officials to conduct a transparent inquiry into the death of journalist Khawar Hussain. Karachi Press Club has also demanded an impartial investigation.

The first post-mortem report published on 17 August 2025, showed that the bullet was of Khawar Hussain own pistol indicating suicide. Forensic teams are, however, still testing all their pieces of evidence to ensure that the murder case of the Khawar Hussain journalist is closed.

Khawar Hussain journalist had almost a decade of experience in broadcast journalism related to the Karachi press and had worked in various news channels including Dawn News. The killing of Khawar Hussain has emerged as one of the leading examples of Pakistani journalist-killing, and there are demands that the press should be safeguarded and made safe in Pakistan.


15. KP Governor Promises Full Support For Flood Affected Families - UrduPoint

MANSEHRA, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 17th Aug, 2025) Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi on Sunday said that the province is passing through a difficult time and collective efforts are needed to overcome the challenges.

He expressed these views while addressing a public gathering in Kaghan on the occasion of former provincial minister Syed Ahmad Shah's joining the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). PPP's provincial president Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, general secretary Shazi Khan, and other leaders were also present.

The Governor said that the people who lost their lives in the devastating rains and floods would not be left alone, adding that he would personally visit their homes to extend support.

He assured that all possible assistance would be provided to the provincial government as required.

Kundi expressed gratitude to the governors of Sindh and Balochistan for assuring their support and paid tribute to the Pakistan Army, saying, "Our brave forces defeated India in just four days, and it will not take long to eliminate terrorists."

16. Immigration agent fires shots at vehicle with people inside in San Bernardino operation

San Bernardino, California, police responded to what they described as "an officer-involved shooting" involving federal immigration officers Saturday morning.

When police officers responded to the area of Acacia Avenue and Baseline Street shortly before 9 a.m., they encountered immigration agents who said they had fired at a suspect who then fled the scene.

Soon after, according to the San Bernardino Police Department, a man -- who has not been identified -- contacted the dispatch center, saying that masked men had tried to pull him over, broke his car window and shot at him. He said he didn't know who they were and asked for police assistance.

In a statement Saturday night, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said agents had been conducting a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino and said that "Customs and Border Protection officers were injured during a vehicle stop when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and tried to run them down."

"In the course of the incident the suspect drove his car at the officers and struck two CBP officers with his vehicle," the statement read. Because of that, the official said, a CBP officer discharged his firearm "in self-defense."

According to a news release from the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, federal agents broke the driver and passenger windows of the vehicle and fired three times. Video the group uploaded on Facebook appeared to capture the interaction, showing agents wearing "police" vests and shouting at those inside to roll down the window.

"No la voy a abrir," the man said from inside, saying he wasn't going to open it.

Soon after, the video captured the sound of shattering glass and what sounded like three shots being fired. The video showed a man wearing a hat with CBP on it.

The video appears to show the vehicle move a short distance after the windows are smashed, but does not capture the driver striking the officers.

"This was a clear abuse of power," the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice said in its release. "Firing at civilians, harassing families without cause, and targeting community voices must stop."

According to the San Bernardino Police Department, officers later located the vehicle in the 1000 block of Mt. View Drive and made contact with the man, but they said it was unclear what federal agents wanted him for.

"Under the California Values Act, California law enforcement agencies are prohibited from assisting federal officials with immigration enforcement, so our officers left the scene as the investigation was being conducted by federal authorities," police said in a news release.

In a statement, a DHS spokesperson misidentified the police department, describing it as the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and said local authorities had the man in custody but then set him free.

"This decision was made despite the subject refusing to comply and wounding two officers -- another terrible example of California's pro-sanctuary policies in action that shield criminals instead of protecting communities," the unidentified spokesperson said.

At 1:12 p.m., federal officials requested assistance from the department because a large crowd was forming as they attempted to arrest the suspect, the police said. At that time, federal agents told police he was wanted for allegedly assaulting a federal officer.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

Police responded and provided support with crowd control, according to the department.

The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice said in a news release that the agents didn't present a warrant and remained outside the home until 3:45 p.m., "pressuring the individual to come outside."

The group added that two community members "were detained using unnecessary force, including one for speaking out."

"Federal agents requested assistance during a lawful arrest for assaulting a federal officer when a crowd created a potential officer safety concern," the police department said in a statement. "This was not an immigration-related arrest, which would be prohibited under California law."

Federal investigators are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting, according to the police.


17. Another Gun Control Fail: 11 Shot in NYC Following Dispute

At least three people were killed and eight others wounded when multiple shooters opened fire in a Brooklyn hookah around 3:30 a.m. Sunday morning.

The New York Post reported that the deceased were all males, one of whom was 27 years of age and another was 35. The third deceased person's age was not immediately known.

FOX News noted that the injuries to the eight victims who survived the shooting were non-life-threatening.

In a press conference later Sunday morning, the NYPD pointed out that officers arrived on scene "within minutes" of the first 911 calls.

NYPD confirmed there were "multiple shooters" involved in the incident and they "have recovered at least 36 shell casings so far from what appears to be multiple guns." (Police had not identified suspects in the shooting at the time of this article.)

Mike Bloomberg-affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety ranks New York number four in the country for gun law stringency, yet three people were shot just before 1:30 a.m. shot Saturday, August 9, 2025, in gun-free Times Square.

Moreover, Breitbart News noted four people were killed-including a NYPD officer-when a gunmen opened fire at a Manhattan office building on July 28, 2025.


18. Putin agreed to let US, Europe offer NATO-style security protections for Ukraine, Trump envoy says - Breitbart

NEW YORK (AP) -- Special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday that Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war.

"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO," he said on CNN's "State of the Union." He added that it "was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that."

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that "we welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine. and the 'Coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share."

Witkoff, offering some of the first details of what was discussed at Friday's summit in Alaska, said the two sides agreeing to "robust security guarantees that I would describe as game-changing." He added that Russia said that it would make a legislative commitment not to go after any additional territory in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington is willing to support security guarantees for Ukraine, but said the details remained unclear.

"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine," he said, "But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees."

Witkoff defended Trump's decision to abandon his push for Russian to agree to an immediate ceasefire, saying the president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.

"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal," Witkoff said, without elaborating.

"We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal," he said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio insisted there would be "additional consequences" as Trump warned before meeting with Putin, if they failed to reach a ceasefire. But Rubio noted that there wasn't going to be any sort of deal on a truce reached when Ukraine wasn't at the talks.

"Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences," Rubio said on ABC's "This Week." "But we're trying to avoid that. And the way we're trying to avoid those consequences is with an even better consequence, which is peace, the end of hostilities."

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, said he did not believe issuing new sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire, noting that the latter isn't off the table but that "the best way to end this conflict is through a full peace deal."

"The minute you issue new sanctions, your ability to get them to the table, our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished," Rubio said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

He also said "we're not at the precipice of a peace agreement" and that getting there would not be easy and would take a lot of work.

"We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off," Rubio said.

Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders are scheduled to meet Monday with Trump at the White House. They heard from the president after his meeting with Putin.

"I think everybody agreed that we had made progress. Maybe not enough for a peace deal, but we are on the path for the first time," Witkoff said.

He added: "The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians -- that could not have been discussed at this meeting" with Putin. "We intend to discuss it on Monday. Hopefully we have some clarity on it and hopefully that ends up in a peace deal very, very soon."


19. This Company Looks Like a Dividend Champion in the Making, and It Could Announce Another Dividend Hike Next Month

This company just initiated its dividend in 2023 but has already hiked it significantly.

Dividend stocks can be great ways for investors to generate reliable, passive income. But finding the right ones is more difficult than you might think. That's because stocks with ultra-high dividend yields may look appealing but have underlying issues. For instance, if a company struggles and its stock sinks significantly, the dividend yield will rise, but the company could still be at risk of a dividend cut.

It's key for investors to analyze company financials and make sure the company can continue to generate enough free cash flow and earnings to not only cover the dividend but also increase the dividend annually. I've found one company could be a Dividend Champion in the making and may even announce another dividend hike next month.

It's one of the larger mobile carriers in the U.S., and T-Mobile's (NASDAQ: TMUS) business has been thriving. Investors have rewarded the stock, sending shares up over 14% this year as of Aug. 14.

For the second-quarter, T-Mobile reported diluted earnings per share of $2.84, up 14% year over year. Total revenue grew nearly 7%. The solid performance was driven by new customer growth, including postpaid net customer additions of 1.7 million, the company's highest second-quarter additions ever and industry leading, according to T-Mobile. The company also grew 5G broadband customers by 454,000, up 12% year over year and industry-leading growth as well.

T-Mobile's success in part stems from its marketing strategy of being the "un-carrier," which essentially means trying to be the opposite of a traditional carrier by eliminating hidden fees and not forcing customers to sign longer-term, more prohibitive contracts.

T-Mobile is a relatively new dividend company, having only initiated its dividend in 2023. The quarterly dividend started at $0.65, but management hiked it to $0.88 in September of 2024, representing a 35% increase. That puts the annual yield at 1.40% at the current stock price, which is not a high dividend yield, but a quick start for a company that's been paying a dividend for less than two years.

The good news is the dividend looks more than sustainable for now and there's room to grow it. The company has a trailing 12-month free cash flow yield of 4.25% and a payout ratio of nearly 31%. To put that in terms that are easier to understand, T-Mobile has paid out about $3.78 billion of dividends over the last year. Management is guiding for $17.8 billion of free cash flow this year at the midpoint of its guidance, plenty to cover the dividend payout.


20. KP CM To Go Allout For Rehabilitation Of Flood Victims - UrduPoint

The CM added that while rescue and relief operations were underway, a comprehensive damage assessment would soon be completed to ensure timely rehabilitation and disbursement of compensation. He reaffirmed that every affected individual would receive 100 percent compensation and that no one would be left out.

1. Bangladesh Denies India's Proposal to Route Exports to the U.S. via Dhaka

*Dhaka, August 17, 2025* -- In a recently revealed policy decision, Bangladesh has turned down India's request to facilitate Indian goods' transit through Bangladesh en route to the United States. The refusal stems from mounting concerns over high U.S. tariffs that apply to re-exported Indian-origin goods, even when routed via third countries without major transformation. Background and Reasoning

Indian exporters had hoped to use Bangladesh as a corridor to reach the U.S. market, seeking relief from rising global logistic costs and sluggish demand. However, under the U.S. reciprocal tariff regime introduced in early April 2025 -- specifically Executive Order and CSMS #64680374 -- tariffs are imposed based on the *origin* of the exporter, not modified by mere transit or re-export. As a result, Indian products sent through Bangladesh without substantial transformation will still be deemed Indian-origin and subject to U.S. tariffs (Textile News link ).

Bangladesh officials also noted that the country currently lacks the necessary industrial infrastructure to perform significant transformation on Indian goods that would reclassify them as Bangladeshi origin. Investing in such capacity would require major foreign direct investment and industrial expansion, which is not yet feasible (Textile News link ). Broader Context: Trade Tensions Intensify

This development unfolds amid broader strains in Bangladesh-India trade relations:

-

In *April 2025*, India abruptly *rescinded a transshipment facility* established in 2020 that allowed Bangladesh to export goods to third countries through Indian land customs stations, ports, and airports. The decision, effective from April 8, was attributed to increasing congestion, delays, and logistical costs affecting India's export operations (The Daily Star link, Business Standard link, Dhaka Tribune link ). -

Moreover, bilateral tensions have escalated following Bangladesh's interim government head Muhammad Yunus's remarks in China -- describing Northeast India as "landlocked" and Bangladesh as its "guardian to the ocean" -- which many viewed in New Delhi as a strategic challenge (ORF Online link, The Diplomat link, India Toda link y.

Trade Impact and Economic Ramifications

The refusal to serve as a transit route to the U.S. reflects a careful economic calculation by Bangladesh. Accepting Indian-origin goods for transit would neither circumvent U.S. tariffs nor enhance Bangladesh's competitiveness; instead, it could compromise policy integrity and overextend its limited industrial-processing capabilities.

Moreover, Bangladesh's own export competitiveness is under strain due to U.S. tariff pressure -- though a relief came recently when it secured a *20% tariff* on garment exports to the U.S., reduced from the initially proposed 37%, offering much-needed support to its $40 billion apparel sector (Reuters link ). Looking Ahead: Strategic and Diplomatic Pathways

-

*Policy Balance*: Bangladesh aims to safeguard its export competitiveness while avoiding policies that may not yield tangible economic benefits. -

*Regional Trade Coordination*: Commentators and trade analysts urge both South Asian nations to prioritize structured dialogue and align trade strategies through regional platforms like BIMSTEC or BBIN to ensure smoother customs processes and resilience amid geopolitical shifts -

*Diplomatic Engagement*: With India navigating both domestic logistic concerns and geopolitical tensions, high-level bilateral talks could lay the groundwork for rebuilding economic trust and exploring conditional, restructured transit arrangements

Bangladesh has declined India's request to route exports to the U.S. through its territory, citing that such a move offers no tariff relief and lacks infrastructural viability. This decision aligns with broader regional trade tensions -- marked by India's revocation of transshipment facilities -- and highlights the intricate balance between economic pragmatism and diplomatic strategy amid evolving global tariff regimes.


2. Putin agreed to let US, Europe offer NATO-style security protections for Ukraine, Trump envoy says

Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a working meeting to discuss the results of the Russia-US summit in Alaska at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025.

Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.

"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO," he told CNN's "State of the Union." He added that it "was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that" and called them "game-changing."

Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.

Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.

Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not "go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more."

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. "We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share," she said.

Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but that much was unclear.

"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine," he said, "But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees," he said.

Witkoff defended Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which Trump had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.

"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal," Witkoff said, without elaborating. "We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal."

4. Pence: Trump Uses a 'Velvet Glove' with Dictators When We Need a Hammer

Former Vice President Mike Pence claimed Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that President Donald Trump used a "velvet glove" with dictators when a "hammer" was needed.

Host Jake Tapper said, "You said last month that you thought President Trump was beginning to realize, 'Vladimir Putin doesn't want peace. Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine.' As you noted, there was no ceasefire agreed to. President Trump seemed to indicate before the summit that that was what had to happen, or he said there would be very severe consequences. Since the summit, he's dropped demands for an immediate ceasefire. Five Ukrainians were killed overnight. He's telling people, you heard Witkoff say a peace deal, a larger peace deal can be reached quickly if Putin's demands, which include Ukraine ceding control of the entire Donbas region to Russia, are met. What do you make of all that? I mean, there are observers out there, people who like Trump, people who are rooting for Trump, who think that Trump got played."

Pence said, "Well, look, I, you know, I served alongside the president for four years. I know his style in dealing with these dictators. It's the velvet glove. But I think the hammer needs to come, and it needs to come immediately. I think the president, as he welcomes President Zelenskyy to the Oval Office tomorrow, and a whole cast of our allies in Europe, are going to be joining him. I think at the same time, he ought to pick up the phone and ask Majority Leader John Thune to immediately pass the secondary sanctions bill that is supported by virtually everyone in the United States Senate. I think the combination of engagement, but also making it clear to Putin that we are prepared to take actions that would literally break his economy, even while we redouble our commitment to the security of Ukraine and to working closely with our European allies, is important."

He added, "Putin only understands strength. So while the president and his diplomatic team engage in this re-approach with Putin, and there seems to be interest in my judgment, Putin is not going to stop until he's stopped."


5. Over 300 protests held Saturday against Trump redistricting push

Pro-democracy activists and labor groups held hundreds of rallies and other events across the United States on Saturday protesting the Trump administration's push for Texas to redraw its congressional map in favor of Republicans.

Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke was among those who spoke on Saturday in Texas, from which dozens of Democratic state lawmakers fled to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a redistricting plan that President Donald Trump had demanded.

"They do this because they are afraid," O'Rourke told an audience on Saturday, speaking of those attempting redistricting. "They fear this power they see here today."

Drucilla Tigner, executive director of pro-democracy coalition Texas For All, told Reuters pro-democracy and labour groups held over 300 events attended by tens of thousands of people in 44 states and Washington, D.C.

Many of the more than 50 Texas Democrats who fled the state have been staying in Illinois, also the site of protests on Saturday. The Texas lawmakers in Illinois are out of reach of civil arrest warrants that could be acted on within Texas.

The Texas Democrats kept the map from coming to a vote during a special session Governor Greg Abbott called that ended Friday. Abbott immediately called a second special session.

Abbott said that redistricting plans, legislation to increase flash flood safety in the wake of deadly July flooding, and other legislative work remains undone because Democrats are absent.

California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday unveiled a redistricting plan in his state that he says would give Democrats there five more Congressional seats, possibly offsetting any Republican gains in Texas.

The Texas House Democrats said in a written statement on Thursday that they will only return to Texas if their state's special legislation is ended and once California's redistricting maps were introduced.


6. Ten countries in the Americas report measles outbreaks in 2025 - The San Pedro Sun

Press Release, Washington, D.C., 15 August 2025 (PAHO) - The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is urging countries in the Americas to strengthen immunization activities, enhance disease surveillance and rapid response interventions, as measles cases continue to rise in the region. As of 8 August 2025, a total of 10,139 confirmed measles cases and 18 related deaths have been reported across ten countries, representing a 34-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024.

The outbreaks are linked primarily to low vaccination coverage, with 71% of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals and a further 18% in people whose vaccination status is unknown. In 2024, coverage with the first dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in the region reached 89% (two percentage points higher than in 2023), while the second dose increased from 76% to 79%. However, these levels remain below the 95% recommended to prevent outbreaks.

"Measles is preventable with two doses of a vaccine, which is proven to be very safe and effective. To stop these outbreaks, countries must urgently strengthen routine immunization and conduct targeted vaccination campaigns in high-risk communities," said Dr. Daniel Salas, Executive Manager of the Special Program for Comprehensive Immunization at PAHO.

Countries with the highest case numbers include Canada (4,548 cases), Mexico (3,911 cases), and the United States (1,356 cases). Other countries reporting confirmed cases are Bolivia (229), Argentina (35), Belize (34), Brazil (17), Paraguay (4), Peru (4), and Costa Rica (1). Paraguay is the latest country to report an outbreak this year. Deaths have been reported in Mexico (14), the United States (3), and Canada (1). In Mexico most deaths have occurred in indigenous people between 1 and 54 years of age. Canada reported a fatal congenital measles infection in a newborn.

The current outbreaks are associated with two genotypes of the measles virus. One genotype has been identified in outbreaks across eight countries, particularly among Mennonite communities in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Belize, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. Given that measles is a highly contagious viral disease, it spreads rapidly among unvaccinated populations, especially children. However, recent data suggests an increasing number of cases outside of these groups.

Countries highlights

In Canada, national trends shows that transmission is persisting, particularly in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario, following an outbreak that began in New Brunswick in October 2024.

In Mexico, a mass vaccination campaign targeting people aged 6 months to 49 years is underway in 14 priority municipalities that have active measles transmission in Chihuahua, which accounts for 93% of the country's cases. Indigenous communities have been hardest hit, with a case-fatality rate 20 times higher than in the general population.

The United States has reported outbreaks in 41 jurisdictions, mainly among under-vaccinated Mennonite populations, though no new cases have been reported in Texas or New Mexico since late July.

In Bolivia, most cases are concentrated in Santa Cruz, with additional cases reported in seven other departments, affecting both the general population and Mennonite communities.

Argentina and Belize have seen no new cases since late June.

Brazil has reported 16 cases in Tocantins, linked to the regional outbreak and affecting members of a small Russian Orthodox community.

PAHO response and recommendations

PAHO is providing direct technical cooperation across the region to support surveillance, case investigation, outbreak response, laboratory diagnostics, and vaccination efforts. This includes deploying experts to countries such as Mexico, Argentina, and Bolivia; monitoring importation risks in Brazil and Paraguay; strengthening surveillance systems; and working with communities and health workers to counter misinformation and promote vaccine uptake.

The Organization urges countries to:

Achieve and sustain high immunization coverage (at least 95% with two doses of measles-containing vaccine),

reinforce rapid response systems to contain outbreaks quickly,

scale up vaccination strategies from selective approaches (such as ring or mop-up vaccination) to mass campaigns in outbreak and high-risk areas, based on the epidemiological situation and population movement.

ensure timely detection and laboratory confirmation of cases,

and engage at-risk communities to improve health literacy and address vaccine hesitancy.

PAHO does not recommend travel restrictions but advises travelers to ensure they are vaccinated, especially when visiting areas with active outbreaks. This includes children aged 6 to 11 months, who are not usually covered by routine immunization programs but should receive early protection in outbreak contexts.

Regional and global context

The Americas interrupted endemic transmission of measles in 2016, a milestone unique at the global level. Although endemic transmission reappeared in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019, both countries regained their elimination status in 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, keeping measles at bay in the Americas remains a challenge, as the virus continues to circulate widely in other parts of the world and vaccine-hesitant groups are spread throughout the region.

Globally, surveillance data from the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 239,816 suspected cases and 108,074 confirmed cases in all WHO Regions, as of July 2025. The Eastern Mediterranean Region accounts for the highest share (35%), followed by the African Region (21%) and the European Region (21%).


7. Baseball-loving Layton man shares the greatness of Satchel Paige

In 1965, at the age of 22, Gordon Loveless -- now of Layton -- stood at the plate at Mulcahy Stadium in Anchorage, Alaska, looking the 60¬Ω feet to the pitcher's mound, waiting for the great Satchel Paige to throw a pitch his way.

As a baseball fan, Loveless was well aware of Paige. He loved baseball and its players -- both major leagues and players in what were then called the Negro leagues -- and he had heard the stories of Paige's prominence over anyone who stepped up to the plate, regardless of skin color.

In those days, baseball players went wherever they had to or wanted to just to play the game. But the presence of a legend like Paige was quite a surprise.

At the time, Paige was 59 years old, well past the ability to throw the rumored 100 mph fastballs that passed a 17-year-old rookie named Willie Mays. Loveless would not be relaxed by Paige's age, though. This was still the man Joe DiMaggio from Loveless' beloved New York Yankees claimed to be the best pitcher he ever faced, according to Yankees history. Paige was in his 40s then.

All of this to say, Loveless was ready when the ball came his way.

"I hit it! Not a base hit, but I hit it out to centerfield. I actually got my bat on it," said Loveless, now 82. "A little bit later, I got a ball and asked him to sign it. I knew I definitely wanted a ball signed by Satchel Paige."

To say this autographed baseball is a prized possession is an understatement. Sure, Loveless comes from a baseball family, and he knew any piece of baseball memorabilia was to be treasured -- but this ball is also a reminder of what could have been between him and Paige.

Loveless was in Anchorage to play baseball with college players from across the country. Paige was in town to play four exhibition games, according to the Alaska Historical Society, all just for fun. He was also asked to manage a future team to be called the Anchorage Earthquakers, a team made up of some of the best college baseball players not already a part of Major League Baseball.

One day, when he returned home to Payson from Alaska, Loveless said he received a letter from Paige himself.

"What we are trying to do is to have a winning ball club, and if you feel like you can help the organization, we would be glad to give you a chance," Paige wrote in the letter. "Answer right back to let me know when you will be able to join the club."

At the bottom of the letter, which was on Earthquakers letterhead, is Paige's signature along with his home address in Kansas City.

As anyone -- especially a baseball fan -- could imagine, Loveless was as excited as he could be. Satchel Paige wrote to this young man, ready to give him a chance to make his baseball dreams come true.

Unfortunately, Loveless could not go to Alaska to play with Paige.

"I got another letter in the mail. This time, this letter was from Uncle Sam," Loveless said.

The Vietnam War was raging, and the United States increased the number of troops in the country in 1965 and 1966. Although there was no official draft at this time, some men received "strongly worded letters" that informed them they needed to show up at a particular location by a certain date. Loveless received one such letter.

He joined the Army reserves before his date, which offset any mandated trip to Vietnam. He also attended Brigham Young University -- after some time playing baseball at the College of Southern Utah, then a junior college -- potentially saving him from a future draft as college attendance allowed for a deferment in the mid-1960s.

His military responsibilities made him unable to play for Paige.

But even if he had not received a letter from Uncle Sam, Loveless would not have been able to play for the legend. Plans changed when it came to the Earthquakers team management, and Paige was no longer a part of the program.

Paige had pitched his last innings when he was 59, throwing three scoreless innings against the Boston Red Sox, according to Major League Baseball. He moved around from team to team, serving as a pitching coach for young players. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971, honoring his time with the Birmingham Barons and Kansas Monarchs in the Negro leagues, as well as his play for teams in Cleveland, Kansas City and St. Louis in the major leagues.

Loveless continued to play baseball and softball on community amateur teams for years during and after completing his college education and military service. He never saw or heard from Satchel Paige again, he says, but he holds his letter and autographed baseball dear.

Loveless has no interest in selling any of his memorabilia, including an autograph from Mickey Mantle received when the great Yankee player was in Vernal one weekend. He just enjoys sharing what did happen and what could have been.

Loveless has spoken to appraisers from PBS's "Antiques Roadshow" regarding the potential value of this autographed baseball, and they urged him to get the autograph authenticated. He is in the process of doing so, as the ball stays locked up tight -- but he does like to show it to other people from time to time.

For now, Loveless is happy to share the stories of Satchel Paige -- who is rumored to have won 2,000 games between the major and negro leagues, pitched every inning of every game for a month in the Negro leagues due to lack of available pitchers, and still threw one-hit games at 59 years old, according to Major League Baseball.

Paige was one of the greatest, as far as Loveless is concerned. He wants to make sure everyone else knows it, too.

"I wish that people really knew what Satchel Paige's contribution was to the game of baseball," he said. "He almost was treated like a God to baseball fans. But I spoke with him, and he was very personable. He's up there with Willie Mays, Josh Gibson, Hank Aaron. He was great."


8. USDA announces plan to halt New World Screwworm - Talk Business & Politics

Last week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced an aggressive initiative to combat the New World Screwworm (NWS).

NWS is a devastating pest. When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal. NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds, and in rare cases, people. It is considered a major threat to the ranching community, but also to the nation's food supply and national security.

NWS threatens over $100 billion in U.S. economic activity tied to the cattle and livestock industry alone. The USDA has rolled out a five-pronged plan to combat New World Screwworm.

Innovation towards eradication

While sterile flies are currently the most effective way to prevent the spread of NWS, technology continues to evolve and as such USDA will provide up to $100 million to invest in viable innovations which could show rapid advancement of promising technologies that will augment the United States facility and accelerate the pace of sterile fly production if proven successful.

Construct a domestic sterile facility

USDA will construct a sterile fly production facility in Edinburg, Texas at Moore Air Force Base, an ideal location due to the existing infrastructure and proximity to the United States-Mexico border. Built with the Army Corps of Engineers, the facility will produce up to 300 million sterile flies per week to combat NWS. This will be the only United States-based sterile fly facility and will work in tandem with facilities in Panama and Mexico to help eradicate the pest and protect American agriculture.

Wildlife migration prevention

Animals don't know borders, and that leaves the U.S potentially vulnerable to NWS from wildlife migrating across the border. USDA is working aggressively to ramp up the hiring of USDA-employed mounted patrol officers, known as "Tick Riders," and other staff who will focus on border surveillance. USDA will also begin training detector dogs to detect screwworm infestations in livestock and other animals along our border and at various ports of entry.

Stop the pest from spreading in Mexico

USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is working in collaboration with the National Service of Agri-Food Health, Safety and Quality (SENASICA) in Mexico to help them contain the pest south of the United States border.

Greater monitoring of U.S. food safety

To date, NWS has not been reported or detected in the United States in animals. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service inspects animals and carcasses at slaughter, including for NWS to keep the food supply safe.

"We have assessed the information on the ground in Mexico and have determined we must construct an additional sterile fly production facility in the United States to stop the northward advancement of this terrible pest that is threatening American cattle production," said Rollins.

"If our ranchers are overrun by foreign pests, then we cannot feed ourselves. USDA and Customs and Border Protection are constantly monitoring our ports of entry to keep NWS away from our borders. We are working every day to ensure our American agricultural industry is safe, secure, and resilient," she added.

"This is bold, decisive action to protect American livestock from the threat of New World Screwworm," said U.S. Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. I commend Secretary Rollins for prioritizing a domestic sterile fly production facility in South Texas and expanding key risk mitigation efforts."


9. VIDEO: Hurricane Erin Graded Category 3 While Churning in Atlantic

Hurricane Erin, the first hurricane of the 2025 season in the Atlantic, was graded a Category 3 on Sunday.

WESH reported the storm is heading north, away from the coastline of the United States, and it was about 170 miles north of San Juan, Puerto Rico, around 8:00 a.m.

As the hurricane sustains winds of 125 miles per hour, the outlet said "The outer bands of Erin are expected to produce heavy rainfall through Sunday across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico."

In a social media post early Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said the storm was moving north and "Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands."

The center later advised the hurricane's outer rainbands were producing gusty winds and heavy rains in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

Officials also noted that "The risk of dangerous and life-threatening rip currents is expected to increase at beaches along the U.S. east coast over the next few days due to Hurricane #Erin."

According to the WESH article, the center said the storm's intensity will fluctuate over the next few days.

Meanwhile, video footage posted Saturday shows NOAA Hurricane Hunters and the U.S. Air Force's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron flying into the eye of the storm to collect data.

The clip shows crew members inside what looks like a circle of clouds:

According to the NOAA website, hurricanes are one of the most powerful types of storms that are known for their strong winds, storm surge flooding, and heavy rainfall.

"Hurricanes, known generically as tropical cyclones, are low-pressure systems with organized thunderstorm activity that form over tropical or subtropical waters. They gain their energy from warm ocean waters," the site read.

"As storm systems strengthen into hurricanes, the surface winds move continuously in a circular motion. Meteorologists refer to this pattern as 'closed circulation,'" it stated.


10. Putin agreed to let US, Europe offer NATO-style security protections for Ukraine, Trump envoy says

Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a working meeting to discuss the results of the Russia-US summit in Alaska at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025.

Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed at his summit with President Donald Trump to allow the United States and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.

"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO," he told CNN's "State of the Union." He added that it "was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that" and called them "game-changing."

Article 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.

Witkoff, who had joined Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the talks Friday at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.

Outlining some of the details about the private discussions, Witkoff also said Russia had agreed to enact a law that it would not "go after any other European countries and violate their sovereignty. And there was plenty more."

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at a news conference in Brussels with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, applauded the move. "We welcome President Trump's willingness to contribute to Article 5-like security guarantees for Ukraine and the 'Coalition of the willing' -- including the European Union -- is ready to do its share," she said.

Zelenskyy thanked the United States for recent signals that Washington was willing to support such guarantees, but that much was unclear.

"It is important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine," he said, "But there are no details how it will work, and what America's role will be, Europe's role will be and what the EU can do, and this is our main task, we need security to work in practice like Article 5 of NATO, and we consider EU accession to be part of the security guarantees," he said.

Witkoff defended Trump's decision to abandon his push that Russian agree to an immediate ceasefire, which Trump had set as a benchmark going into the meeting. Witkoff said the Republican president had pivoted toward a peace deal because so much progress was made.

"We covered almost all the other issues necessary for a peace deal," Witkoff said, without elaborating. "We began to see some moderation in the way they're thinking about getting to a final peace deal."

RELATED STORY | Ukraine's Zelenskyy to meet Trump on Monday after US-Russia summit secured no halt to fighting

Rubio, who appeared on three Sunday news shows, said there was not going to be any kind of truce reached because Ukraine was not at the summit.

"Now, ultimately, if there isn't a peace agreement, if there isn't an end of this war, the president's been clear, there are going to be consequences," Rubio said on ABC's "This Week." "But we're trying to avoid that."

Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, said he did not believe imposing new U.S. sanctions on Russia would force Putin to accept a ceasefire.

"The minute you issue new sanctions, your ability to get them to the table, our ability to get them to table will be severely diminished," Rubio told NBC's "Meet the Press."

He also said "we're not at the precipice of a peace agreement" and that getting there would not be easy and would take a lot of work.

"We made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement, but there remains some big areas of disagreement. So we're still a long ways off," Rubio said.

Zelenskyy and Europeans leaders, who heard from Trump after the summit, are scheduled to meet with him at the White House on Monday.

"I think everybody agreed that we had made progress. Maybe not enough for a peace deal, but we are on the path for the first time," Witkoff said.

He added: "The fundamental issue, which is some sort of land swap, which is obviously ultimately in the control of the Ukrainians -- that could not have been discussed at this meeting" with Putin. "We intend to discuss it on Monday. Hopefully we have some clarity on it and hopefully that ends up in a peace deal very, very soon."

1. [Finlight] Brooklyn lounge shooting leaves 3 dead, 8 hurt; police seek multiple suspects

Three people were killed and eight others wounded in a shooting at a crowded nightclub in Brooklyn early Sunday (August 17) morning, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

Officers responded to multiple emergency calls at about 3.27am reporting gunfire inside Taste of the City Lounge at 903 Franklin Avenue, in the Crown Heights neighborhood, Tisch told reporters at the scene.

"Officers arrived within minutes of the first 911 calls and found numerous gunshot victims inside the location. Currently we have identified 11 victims ranging in age from 27 to 61, eight males and three females," Tisch said.

Three men ‚Äì aged 27, 35, and one of unknown age ‚Äì were pronounced dead at the scene. The other eight victims were transported to local hospitals with injuries described as non-life-threatening. Names of the victims are being withheld pending family notification.

Tisch said preliminary investigation indicated a dispute inside the packed club led to the shooting, involving multiple shooters.

At least 36 shell casings from multiple firearms were recovered, and police also found a gun near Bedford Avenue and Eastern Parkway.

Detectives are reviewing CCTV footage and searching for suspects, but no arrests have been made.

"Eleven people shot, three dead. It‚Äôs a terrible shooting that occurred in the city of New York," Tisch said.

The commissioner noted that shootings in New York City have reached record lows this year, calling Sunday‚Äôs incident "an anomaly" and promising a thorough investigation.

Tisch said there had been a non-fatal shooting at the same location in November 2024, but could not confirm whether metal detectors or other security measures were in place at the club.

Police cordoned off the area with tape and continued to collect evidence at the scene later Sunday morning.


2. [Finlight] Warren Buffett Doubles Down On America's Housing Boom, Upping Berkshire's Holdings In Homebuilders And Building Supply Firms By Triple Digits

Warren Buffett‚Äòs Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) has made a significant pivot towards the U.S. housing market, according to its second-quarter 13F filing for 2025, which was filed on Aug. 14, 2025.
The legendary investor established several new positions in home construction and building supply companies while dramatically increasing his stake in another, signaling a strong conviction in the sector.
Summary Of Berkshire‚Äôs Key Housing-Related Moves In Q2

Buffett Bets On Homebuilders
The most notable move was a 136% increase in Berkshire‚Äôs holding of Pool Corp. (NASDAQ:POOL), a distributor of swimming pool supplies. 
The position grew from 1,464,000 shares in the first quarter to 3,458,885 shares by the end of the second quarter on June 30, 2025.
Berkshire Hathaway initiated major new stakes in two of the largest U.S. homebuilders:

Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN): Berkshire added a new stake of 7,048,993 Class A shares worth $779.69 million. This is in addition to boosting its existing stake in Lennar Corp.‚Äôs Class B (NYSE:LEN) shares by 19%, from 152,572 to 180,930 shares. The total value of Berkshire‚Äôs Lennar holdings is now approximately $799 million.

Expanding Into Building Materials And Supplies

3. [Finlight] Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple and Bank of America Stock and Piling Into an Embattled Healthcare Stock Down 46% This Year

Apple has been dealing with tariff-related issues all year. Buffett and Berkshire may have foreseen this once President Donald Trump won the election, leading them to pare back their position. If Berkshire is concerned about the economy, perhaps paring back some of their bank holdings makes sense as well, as banks are typically cyclical.

There's also talk that Berkshire is staying conservative to prepare for the big transition that will see Buffett step down as CEO but retain his role as chairman of the board of directors. Longtime Berkshire veteran Greg Abel is set to step into Buffett's big shoes. Berkshire's stock got off to a terrific start this year but has floundered since the transition was announced.

While the bull market has raged for more than 2.5 years, Berkshire has plodded along conservatively, hoarding hundreds of billions of dollars in cash and cash equivalents, selling more stocks than it buys, and even turning away from share repurchases more recently. Given stretched valuations and the stock market's big run, many investors simply think Buffett and his team are not seeing compelling opportunities.

In the second quarter, Berkshire continued to trim its largest position, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and its third-largest holding, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). In the quarter, Berkshire sold 7% of its stake in Apple and 4% of its stake in Bank of America. Over the past year, Berkshire has reduced its stake in Apple by 30% and Bank of America by 41%.

While Berkshire has been quiet in recent quarters, the large conglomerate made some notable moves in the second quarter. Berkshire recently sold some shares in two of its largest positions, while piling into an embattled healthcare stock that has struggled immensely this year.

Each quarter, investors anxiously await Warren Buffett's company B erkshire Hathaway filing its 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, divulging what stocks Berkshire held at the end of the quarter, and, therefore, what stocks the company bought and sold in any given quarter. Investors are always looking for a glimpse into the genius of Buffett and his team of investors, especially with Buffett set to step down as CEO of the company at the end of the year.

Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's team of investors continued a recent trend in trimming down their positions in Apple and Bank of America.

Story Continues

Playing contrarian on this healthcare giant

In the second quarter, Berkshire initiated a $1.57 billion position in the nation's largest healthcare insurer, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH). UnitedHealth's stock has been crushed this year and is down about 46%. However, after the news came out about Berkshire buying the stock, shares increased close to 9.5% in after-hours trading.

UnitedHealth has dealt with a flurry of issues this year, including higher medical insurance costs, which is a common trend across the sector. In the second quarter, management at UnitedHealth revised its prior full-year outlook down to $16 adjusted earnings per share, significantly below Wall Street's consensus estimates coming into the year.

The main culprit is medical costs, which management thinks will come in $6.5 billion higher than previously expected. The sector has struggled in the face of an aging population, higher utilization of and more expensive services, higher drug prices, and inflation.

Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing UnitedHealth in a criminal investigation over the way it charges customers in its Medicare Advantage program. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported on suspicious billing practices that allegedly increase payouts to the company. In a statement in late July, UnitedHealth said it is cooperating with the DOJ but has "full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process."

At their core, Buffett and his team are value investors, meaning they look for stocks with a market value below a company's perceived intrinsic value. While UnitedHealth has struggled and is forecasting a significant earnings decline this year, management is still projecting double-digit revenue growth in 2025. Furthermore, the company's balance sheet seems to be on solid footing. Sure, the company has high debt, but through the first six months of the year, earnings from operations of about $14.3 billion are still more than 7 times debt interest expense.

Additionally, UnitedHealth's dividend yield is now roughly 3.25%, while the company's trailing free-cash-flow yield is above 10%, showing the company can easily cover the dividend for the foreseeable future. In fact, UnitedHealth recently increased its quarterly dividend by 5%.

Ultimately, UnitedHealth trades at a lower-than-usual forward price-to-earnings ratio, despite expectations of much lower earnings this year, and at less than 1 times revenue. Buffett and his team value strong moats, so with UnitedHealth still controlling market share in the healthcare insurance industry, they likely see an attractive risk-reward proposition.

4. [Finlight] Jack Dorsey Advocates for Bitcoin Use as Everyday Currency 'As It Was Designed to Be'

Block CEO Jack Dorsey¬†has once again emphasized his stance on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), advocating for its use as everyday money, a vision originally proposed by Bitcoin‚Äôs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.
What Happened: Dorsey stressed that Bitcoin‚Äôs ultimate purpose should be for daily transactions, not merely¬†speculative trading. 
‚ÄúWe want Bitcoin¬†to become p2p electronic cash¬†and everyday money, as it¬†was designed to be,‚Äù Dorsey¬†stated in a post on X.

Dorsey‚Äôs comments were in response to a post by Entropy Capital regarding how Block has developed a comprehensive Bitcoin ecosystem. This system comprises Square, a platform that¬†allows merchants to accept Bitcoin¬†payments, and Cash App, a wallet designed for quick and inexpensive transactions. 
Other elements include¬†Bitkey, a self-custody hardware wallet¬†for offline Bitcoin storage, and Proto, a Bitcoin mining infrastructure.
Also Read: Jack Dorsey Says Bluesky‚Äôs Rapid Expansion Fueled by X Exodus: ‚ÄòNot a Great Way To Build a Product‚Äô
Dorsey‚Äôs message is unequivocal: Bitcoin is destined to become a¬†part of everyday transactions, and¬†Block is strategically positioning itself to facilitate this transition.
Simultaneously, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent¬†has indicated that the U.S.¬†is dedicated to exploring ways to accumulate more Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $118,473.47, a slight dip from its intraday peak of $119,399.29.
Why It Matters: Dorsey‚Äôs renewed emphasis on Bitcoin‚Äôs intended use as everyday money underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream financial landscape. 
With Block‚Äôs comprehensive Bitcoin ecosystem, the company is well-positioned to lead the charge in this transition, potentially influencing other companies to follow suit. 
Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs interest in accumulating Bitcoin signals a shift in governmental attitudes towards cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for more widespread adoption and regulatory clarity.

5. [Finlight] What to Know About Russia-U.S.-Ukraine Peace Talks

How did Ukraine and the E.U. react?

Amid the setbacks for Ukraine, officials in Kyiv found one glimmer of hope. They seized on a U.S. proposal to include security guarantees for Ukraine, designed to deter future Russian aggression, in a potential peace deal.

Mr. Trump conveyed the proposal to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a call early Saturday after the meeting. It would enlist Kyiv‚Äôs Western partners to guarantee Ukraine‚Äôs defense against new Russian attacks. Crucially, Mr. Trump indicated that the United States was ready to participate in such guarantees ‚Äî a shift from his earlier position that Ukraine‚Äôs postwar security should be left solely to Europe.

The outcome of the talks received a chilly reception in Europe, where leaders have time and again seen Mr. Trump reverse positions on Ukraine after speaking with Mr. Putin. But Ukrainian and European leaders also believe the worst did not happen. Mr. Trump did not limit European aid to Kyiv, or agree to hand over chunks of Ukraine to Russia ‚Äî at least not yet.

The outcome of the Alaska meeting reveals an underlying problem for Ukraine and the Europeans. European leaders have no strategy of their own for ending the war, let alone for defeating Moscow. Instead, they have been racing to keep up with Mr. Trump‚Äôs variable stances, trying to hold him to certain red lines that protect Ukrainian sovereignty and European security.

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has long been the front runner in the electric vehicle (EV) revolution in the U.S. Its innovation, brand strength, and rapid growth have made it a favorite among investors.

Yet, despite its impressive track record, there are two big risks that investors should carefully consider before buying Tesla stock today.

1. The Elon Musk factor

Elon Musk's leadership is often cited as Tesla's greatest strength -- and, paradoxically, one of its most significant vulnerabilities. Musk's vision and hands-on approach have driven Tesla's technological breakthroughs and ambitious expansion. However, this heavy reliance on a single individual introduces what investors refer to as "key man risk."

If Musk were to step back from daily operations or shift his focus to other projects, Tesla might face challenges in maintaining its momentum. Though Tesla's management team has grown stronger, few executives command the same vision, drive, and public attention as Musk.

Recently, Musk's increasing involvement in political activities has raised concerns about potential distractions or reputational risks for Tesla. While the company has remained operationally strong, these developments underscore the uncertainty around its future leadership continuity. While Tesla's success lies not only with Musk but also with his team, which has executed well on his vision -- no one can build a trillion-dollar company alone -- there is still no clear successor (or a viable management team) . The silver lining here is that the Tesla board has become more serious about finding one in recent months, largely due to the CEO's active involvement in politics.

For investors, this means that Tesla's fortunes remain closely tied to Musk's presence and decisions -- a factor that adds a layer of risk to the investment.

2. Intensifying competition

Tesla might have been an early mover in the EV industry, but its dominance is no longer guaranteed. The industry landscape is rapidly evolving, with legacy automakers and new entrants accelerating their electric ambitions.

Companies like Ford and General Motors are aggressively expanding their EV lineups. For instance, Ford plans to introduce a $30,000 midsize truck by 2027. That price is significantly lower than the average for an EV, and Ford is investing $5 billion in its EV production to make it happen. GM, on the other hand, is working hard on next-generation battery technologies to improve range, charging performance, and cost.


7. [Finlight] Israel intensifies Gaza City attacks, forcing starving Palestinians to flee

UN warns of man-made famine in Gaza as starvation deaths rise and Israel steps up plan to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza.

Israel‚Äôs military has stepped up attacks on Gaza City as part of its expanded operations aimed at seizing the last major population centre in the enclave, forcing tens of thousands of starving Palestinians to flee again.

The Gaza City neighbourhoods of Zeitoun, Sabra, Remal and Tuffah have particularly borne the brunt of the Israeli bombardments in recent days as a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Israel‚Äôs plans to forcibly displace Palestinians to southern Gaza would increase their suffering.

Thousands of families have fled Zeitoun, where days of continuous strikes have left the neighbourhood devastated. At least seven people were killed on Sunday when an Israeli air strike hit al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.

Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said tents and equipment to erect shelters will be provided to the Palestinians who have been displaced multiple times in 22 months of war, which has been called an act of genocide by multiple rights organisations.

Al Jazeera‚Äôs Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said artillery fire and air raids have forced many from their homes.

‚ÄúThe Zeitoun neighbourhood is a very densely populated area, home to many families, including those who have been sheltering there. Residents were surprised when the artillery shelling and the intensive air raids started. Some people stayed. Others started moving. As the violence escalated, many were forced to evacuate ‚Äì hungry, devastated and displaced yet again, leaving behind everything they had,‚Äù Khoudary said.

‚ÄòNew wave of genocide‚Äô

Israel last week announced plans to push deeper into Gaza City and remove its residents to the south, a move that has drawn international condemnation.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, said civilians would be moved to ‚Äúsafe zones‚Äù even though these areas have also been repeatedly bombed.

Nearly 90 percent of the 2.4 million Palestinians in Gaza remain displaced, and an overwhelming number of them are now facing starvation. At least seven more Palestinians died of starvation in Gaza in 24 hours, Gaza‚Äôs Ministry of Health said on Sunday, raising the war‚Äôs hunger-related death toll to 258, including 110 children, as a result of Israel‚Äôs ongoing siege of the enclave.

On Sunday, Israel killed nearly 40 Palestinians, half of them aid seekers, taking the total number of Palestinians killed since the war began in October 2023 to 61,827.

Hamas denounced Israel‚Äôs plan to set up tents in the south as a cover for mass displacement.

The group said in a statement that the measure amounted to a ‚Äúnew wave of genocide and displacement‚Äù and described it as a ‚Äúblatant deception intended to cover up a brutal crime that the occupation forces prepare to execute‚Äù.

There was an atmosphere of despair in Gaza after Israel‚Äôs latest forced displacement order, Maram Humaid, Al Jazeera‚Äôs online correspondent from Gaza, posted on X.

‚ÄúThere are no words to describe how people in Gaza feel right now. Fear, helplessness, and pain fill everyone as they face a new wave of displacement and an Israeli ground operation,‚Äù she posted.

‚ÄúFamily and friends‚Äô WhatsApp groups are full of silent screams and sorrow. God knows people have suffered enough. Our minds are almost paralysed from thinking.‚Äù

Displaced and desperate Palestinians are scrambling for scraps of food as they face more bombardment from Israeli forces.

The UN says one in five children in Gaza is malnourished as tens of thousands rely on charity kitchens, whose small portions of food can be their only meal of the day.

‚ÄúI came at 6am to the charity kitchen to get food for my children, and if I don‚Äôt get any now, I have to come back in the evening for another chance,‚Äù said Zeinab Nabahan, displaced from the Jabalia refugee camp, told Al Jazeera.

‚ÄúMy children are starving on small amounts of lentils or rice. My children haven‚Äôt had bread or any breakfast. They‚Äôve been waiting for me to leave with whatever I can get from the charity kitchen.‚Äù

Another resident, Tayseer Naim, told Al Jazeera that ‚Äúhad it not been for God and charity kitchens‚Äù, he would not have survived. ‚ÄúWe come here at 8am and suffer to get lentils or rice. We suffer a lot, and we leave at midday and walk for about a kilometre.‚Äù

‚ÄòMan-made famine‚Äô

On Sunday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned that Gaza is facing a ‚Äúman-made famine‚Äù and urged a return to a UN-led distribution system.

‚ÄúWe are very, very close to losing our collective humanity,‚Äù Juliette Touma, the agency‚Äôs communications director, said in a post on X.

She said the crisis had been fuelled by ‚Äúdeliberate attempts to replace the UN-coordinated humanitarian system through the politically motivated ‚ÄòGHF‚Äô.‚Äù

She warned the alternative system promoted by Israel and the United States ‚Äúbrings dehumanisation, chaos, and death‚Äù and stressed: ‚ÄúWe must return to a unified, UN-led coordination and distribution system based on international humanitarian law. The abomination must end.‚Äù

The World Food Programme (WFP) says despite its teams ‚Äúdoing everything‚Äù to deliver food assistance in Gaza, current supplies only meet 47 percent of the intended target.

According to the UN agency, around 500,000 people are now on the ‚Äúbrink of famine‚Äù, and that only a ceasefire would allow food assistance to be scaled up to the required levels.

The Government Media Office in Gaza said Israel was deliberately starving Palestinians by blocking essential goods, including baby formula, nutritional supplements, meat, fish, dairy products, and frozen fruits and vegetables.

In a statement on Telegram, it said Israel was carrying out ‚Äúa systematic policy of engineered starvation and slow killing against more than 2.4 million people in Gaza, including more than 1.2 million Palestinian children, in a complete crime of genocide‚Äù.

It warned that more than 40,000 infants face severe malnutrition while at least 100,000 other children and patients are in a similar condition.

Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network in Gaza City, told Al Jazeera that aid workers were struggling to respond as resources collapse.

‚ÄúWe are trying to do our best. We are ‚Ä¶ part of this social fabric. We are linked to the people here, and we are staying with them while Israel threatens to apply its plans to forcibly evacuate Gaza City and destroy the rest of Gaza. There are 1.1 million people here, most of them elderly, women, children and people with disabilities,‚Äù Shawa said.

He said workers continued to provide limited meals, medical care and education but warned that ‚Äúthe humanitarian system is collapsing‚Äù as Israel strikes aid facilities and restricts supplies.


8. [Finlight] Hurricane Erin weakens to category 3 as parts of Caribbean brace for tropical storm

Hurricane Erin was downgraded to a category 3 hurricane early Sunday as a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands ‚Äì and winds and heavy rains whipped the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, reached category 5 status before weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205kph), according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.

The storm‚Äôs center was about 155 miles (245km) north of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and nearly 300 miles (500km) east of the Grand Turk Island, moving west-northwest at 14mph (22kph).

A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, and in this case, within 24 hours, the NHC said. Heavy rain is still expected across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, with rainfall of 3 to 6in (about 7.6 to 15cm), with 8in (20cm) in some isolated areas.

More than 159,000 customers were without power in Puerto Rico, a US territory, as a result of Hurricane Erin on Sunday morning, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power on the island.

Swells were also expected to affect portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple of days, the NHC reported.

The government of the Bahamas also issued a tropical storm watch for the south-east Bahamas.

Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes in the Atlantic to climate change, which is driven by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming is causing the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and is spiking ocean temperatures, and warmer waters give hurricanes fuel to unleash more rain and strengthen more quickly.


9. [Finlight] Trump admin under fire: Over 300 protests sweep 44 states; Texas Democrats outraged over Republicans‚Äô push to redraw maps

Across the United States, pro-democracy activists and labor organizations rallied against the Trump administration's support for Texas's Republican-favored redistricting plan. Texas Democrats, who fled to Illinois to block the plan, prompted Governor Abbott to call a second special session.


10. [Finlight] US tariffs impact on jobs: Nearly 3 lakh workers at risk in textiles and gems; Here‚Äôs what experts say

The steep tariffs imposed on Indian exports to the US have triggered sharp debate among staffing specialists, with some flagging the risk of immediate job losses and others suggesting that India‚Äôs domestic demand and trade diversification could soften the blow.‚ÄúThe recent imposition of additional US tariffs is expected to have a direct and substantial impact on India's employment landscape. This will especially impact those industries relying heavily on the US market for business continuity and growth,‚Äù Genius HRTech founder, chairman and managing director R P Yadav told PTI.Yadav identified textiles, auto components, agriculture, and gems and jewellery as the most vulnerable sectors, warning that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) will absorb the heaviest shock. He estimated that 2,00,000 to 3,00,000 jobs are at immediate risk, with textiles alone‚Äîbeing labour-intensive‚Äîpotentially losing as many as 1,00,000 positions if the tariff regime remains in force for over six months.He further cautioned that gems and jewellery hubs in Surat and SEEPZ, Mumbai, could also face widespread job losses due to shrinking demand and rising costs in the US market.However, not all experts foresee an employment crisis.TeamLease Services Senior Vice President Balasubramanian Anantha Narayanan argued that India‚Äôs reliance on domestic consumption makes its job market less vulnerable than China‚Äôs.‚ÄúAt this point in time, we aren't seeing any signs of a slowdown or loss of jobs. This also by extension means that our jobs are largely in service of domestic demand too, with the exception of some sectors like ITeS among others. Our exports to the USA are USD 87 billion, which is roughly about 2.2 per cent of our overall GDP. Largely pharma, electronics etc. won't be affected for now, which will further limit the export exposure to industries such as textiles, gems and jewellery among others,‚Äù he said, quoted PTI.He also noted that the tariffs are yet to take effect, leaving space for possible negotiations. ‚ÄúOn the other side, we've also had several positives by way of the recently closed FTA with the UK and other countries. Even if these US tariffs do come about, we'll definitely figure out a way of redirecting or diversifying our trade to other markets. Therefore, at this point in time, we aren't seeing any signs of a slowdown or loss of jobs. It's an evolving situation and we'll get to know more in due course of time,‚Äù Narayanan said.According to him, the broader drag on employment stems from global consumption slowdown, tariff uncertainties, and ongoing geopolitical conflicts.CIEL HR MD and CEO Aditya Mishra said the tariff scenario is unsettling exporters in sectors deeply tied to the American market‚Äîincluding electronics, textiles, gems and jewellery, auto components, leather, footwear, shrimp and engineering goods.‚ÄúEven industries outside the direct tariff ambit, like pharmaceuticals, are feeling the ripple effect through costlier upstream chemicals and materials,‚Äù Mishra said. He added that uncertainty could persist through the third quarter of this financial year as negotiations unfold.While Mishra does not expect widespread layoffs, he noted that companies are already adopting cost-control measures‚Äîcutting discretionary spends, streamlining production, freezing hiring, and putting pressure on temporary and contractual roles. ‚ÄúThe immediate pressure will be on temporary and contract roles, particularly shop-floor workers, artisans, sales and logistics staff, and some mid-level managers in export-led units. This will have a cascading effect on thousands of MSMEs in the supply chain, which collectively account for a large share of employment,‚Äù he warned.Mishra also pointed to potential spillover risks for IT and global capability centres (GCCs). ‚ÄúThe IT sector is already experiencing slow spending and hiring, and this additional uncertainty could delay its recovery further. GCCs are likely to take a cautious approach to hiring and investments until there is greater clarity on trade negotiations and market stability. If the tariff situation persists, India's market share in the US could shrink, leading to longer-term repercussions for exporters and the industries that depend on them,‚Äù he said.

1. Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems - SiliconANGLE

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.
