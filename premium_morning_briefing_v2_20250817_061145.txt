2. Vegas Advisor: Plan halted to build $270 million casino | Honolulu Star-Advertiser

Already a Honolulu Star-Advertiser subscriber? Log in now to continue reading.

One of Las Vegas' biggest pending projects has been taken off the table. Restaurateur and owner of the Golden Nugget casinos, Tilman Fertitta, has aborted his plan to build a $270 million casino on a six-acre parcel at the corner of Harmon Avenue and the Strip. While a slumping Las Vegas economy and Fertitta's preoccupation with his appointment as the U.S. ambassador to Italy likely contributed to the decision, his status as the largest stockholder in Wynn Resorts was cited as the primary reason. A Fertitta spokesperson issued a statement saying that "building a competing high-end resort only a mile down the street would be a conflict of interest." The vacant property has been turned into a parking lot and will remain so for the foreseeable future.

Tables gone: Downtown's Golden Gate has announced that it's eliminating live table games. The live games will be replaced with electronic versions of blackjack, craps, roulette and possibly some "carnival games." It's not all bad news for table-games players, as the interfaces of the electronic games have improved markedly in recent years and often come with lower minimum-bet requirements. The changeover is expected to be completed by the end of September.

Boomer's opens: The first Las Vegas location of several planned Boomer's Sportsbooks has opened at Ellis Island. Its current location in the casino is temporary, as a bigger presence will be incorporated into a redesign of the casino that's currently in progress.

Question: Is the Nevada representative in the Little League World Series from Las Vegas?

Answer: Yes. Summerlin South is an all-star collection of area players. The team made it all the way to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., as the Mountain region representative among the final 20 teams from around the world.


3. Police clock two bikes above 110mph speeding on M40

Two bikes have been clocked at over 100mph on the M40 by police across the border from Oxfordshire.

Thames Valley Police (TVP) caught the bikers this morning (Sunday, August 17) between the motorway's Junctions 4 and 5 near Stokenchurch.

Travelling at 111mph, the offenders were reported to court by officers at the scene.

The police force posted the news on their Facebook channels alongside a photograph of the offence.

A spokesperson for TVP said: "It's a gorgeous day for a ride, but remember to ride safely and keep within the limits on the roads.

"We have already stopped two motorcyclists travelling in convoy on the M40 J5-4 that were recorded at 111mph.

"This has not only ruined their Sunday, but risked their safety and others on this busy stretch of motorway.

"Motorcycles are often high-performance machines, but we must observe the limits.

"The riders were reported to court due to the high speed. Remember, ride safe, it's not worth the risk."


4. Midfielder frustrated as price tag blocks career changing move to Man United

According to IndyKaila News, Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba is becoming increasingly frustrated with his current situation as he sees his dream move to Manchester United stall due to the Seagulls' valuation.

The Cameroonian talent, highly regarded as one of the most promising young midfielders in the Premier League, feels Brighton have placed an unrealistic price tag on him, effectively pricing him out of a transfer.

Baleba has quickly established himself as a dynamic presence in Brighton's midfield. He has caught the attention of some of the biggest clubs due to his consistent performances. He has contributed greatly to Brighton's attack as well as defense, bridging the gap between the attack and defense.

It is precisely those attributes that have caught the eye of Man United manager Ruben Amorim, who views him as a perfect long-term addition to strengthen United's midfield spine.

Brighton value the young midfielder at more than ¬£100m, a figure that is deemed unacceptable by United.

While Brighton's stance reflects their determination not to lose another key player cheaply, it has left Baleba feeling disappointed, with sources suggesting he believes the price set does not justify his talent.

For Baleba, the opportunity to join Man United is a significant career milestone. The midfielder is said to be keen on the transfer, viewing Old Trafford as the perfect platform to continue his growth, play at the highest level, and compete for major honours.

His determination to make the switch is evident, but without Brighton softening their stance, the deal remains complicated.

From United's perspective, while Baleba is a top target, the club is also cautious about overspending after several high-profile signings in recent years have not delivered the expected returns.

With Brighton closing the door for Baleba's transfer to Old Trafford, the Red Devils are expected to search for alternative options in the market.


5. Edinburgh Oasis fan left 'bawling her eyes out' as Murrayfield ticket was 'void'

An Edinburgh woman has been left feeling like she's had a "death in the family" after the ticket her partner bought her for Oasis' much anticipated return to Murrayfield turned out to be bogus.

Charisse Quinn, 42, who now lives in East Ayrshire, had got herself fully kitted out for the gig, convinced her friend to come along and splurged on a ¬£250 ticket from the popular ticket resale site Viagogo for the last night of the Edinburgh stint of the Live '25 tour on Tuesday, August 12.

But instead of singing her heart out all night, Charisse said she was left 'bawling her eyes out' when the ticket she purchased failed to load outside the stadium.

She was left heartbroken and disappointed when she realised the ticket had already been sold by the seller and was voided.

After being contacted by Edinburgh Live, Viagogo bosses apologised to Charisse and confirmed she received a refund and was given the opportunity to see Oasis another night.

Sharing her experience with Edinburgh Live, Charisse said: "I'd finished night shift on the Tuesday morning and came home for a couple hours sleep. Bear in mind my partner had bought the ticket on Friday, so he got the ticket and on Tuesday all day practically we were waiting for them to send the actual ticket, but they said that it was going to be guaranteed it regardless, but nothing came of it.

"My partner, he was working and he couldn't even really concentrate at his work because he was too busy trying to get in touch with Viagogo."

The friend that she had convinced to tag along also bought a last minute ticket and got into the venue, leaving Charisse to drown her sorrows at a local pub.

She continued: "I'm still heartbroken about it. I went back to work last night and I'm a mental health nurse so all my patients were asking me how it was and it's just, I know this sounds really dramatic right, but it actually feels like a death in the family.

"Because I was that excited and everything for that as a last minute ticket purchase and then this happened.

"The fact that I spent money on my whole outfit as well as getting there. Before that like I was out for drinks with some of my friends and all that and it was just such a high and then I was absolutely devastated, really, really sad, and apparently there was another couple that my friends had came across that I think the lady got in but her husband didn't.

"I was proper bawling my eyes out, you know like when you can't even speak or anything, you're just so like upset, crying and bubbling away."

Devastated, Charisse spent the whole day in bed on Wednesday nursing her heartbreak.

A Viagogo spokesperson said: "Viagogo is a safe, secure and regulated marketplace. We are aware of an isolated issue affecting a customer who was unable to access their tickets for the Oasis event on 12 August 2025, despite receiving a ticket transfer confirmation from a fan seller.

"This incident fell short of Viagogo's standards and we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this caused. The customer has received a refund and given the opportunity to see Oasis another night.

"There is no financial incentive for sellers to list tickets on our marketplace that they cannot deliver, since they are not paid until after the buyer successfully gets into the event. Sellers in breach of our terms and conditions will face consequences including fines and removal from the platform.

1. Lawyer 'very confident' a foreign adversary attacked Canadian diplomats in Cuba - Medicine Hat News

OTTAWA -- A lawyer for Canadian diplomats and their families says he believes the mysterious ailments they suffered in Cuba were caused by a foreign adversary, despite a federal government report that dismisses the theory. Eight years after foreign service officials and their dependants began reporting such symptoms as headaches, memory loss, mood changes, vision problems, nausea and nosebleeds, a legal action against Ottawa over the health problems is still grinding along in Federal Court. The 17 plaintiffs, who seek millions of dollars in damages, allege the Canadian government failed to protect them, hid crucial information and downplayed the seriousness of the risks. The government has denied negligence and wrongdoing. Several U.S. personnel who worked in Cuba have reported similar health issues, commonly known as Havana Syndrome. Theories about the cause have included pesticide spraying, the effect of chirping crickets, malfunctioning eavesdropping devices, and targeted energy or sonic attacks by an enemy state. The Canadian government says it has found no evidence of foul play by a foreign adversary. A Global Affairs Canada report completed in August 2024 says the department has concluded that the unexplained health incidents "were not the result of a malicious act of a foreign actor." The report, drawing on the work of an interdepartmental task force and external experts, says pre-existing medical conditions, environmental factors and conventional illnesses "were likely to have been important factors in many of the symptoms experienced." The report adds that the findings "do not cast doubt on the authenticity of the symptoms reported by staff members and their dependants." Paul Miller, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told The Canadian Press he is "very confident" a foreign actor is to blame for the Canadians' health difficulties. "I really trust the people that I have spoken with and met with," he said. "I have absolutely no faith in the (Global Affairs Canada) report because they are trying to put out the narrative that works for them." The plaintiffs' court action, filed in 2019, remains unresolved. Three years ago, the parties agreed to the appointment of a former Supreme Court judge to mediate the claims of nine family members in the case. Miller said the two days of talks in early 2023 "just went nowhere." He said he has made efforts to file new information in the case but the material is being treated as confidential pending the resolution of concerns about the disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information, as defined by the Canada Evidence Act. The Global Affairs report traces the various steps federal agencies have taken over the years in response to the illness complaints, including security, medical and environmental assessments. A multi-agency Integrated National Security Enforcement Team, led by the RCMP, opened an investigation in June 2017. Global Affairs and RCMP officials began travelling regularly to Cuba as part of the investigation to look at the possibility of malicious attacks, the report says. Canadian officials also shared information with foreign partners, including the United States. In 2019, instruments designed to detect and capture evidence of acoustic and radiation surges, and to measure environmental effects -- such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and ozone levels -- were installed in the living quarters of Canadian staff in Havana. "The data collected from the instruments did not provide relevant and probative information to identify a cause for the symptoms," the Global Affairs report says. "As such, in 2022, the instruments were removed." The integrated national security team concluded "there was no criminality and no evidence attributing these health symptoms to a foreign actor," the report adds. "In their conclusions, the RCMP and other domestic partner agencies assess that there is no known criminality, no known attribution for (unexplained health incidents) and no patterns related to symptoms, age, gender, location, or other variable." The U.S. intelligence community looked at possible evidence of a foreign adversary's involvement, the feasibility of tools that could cause the reported symptoms and whether medical analysis could help find answers. A March 1, 2023, report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council said these lines of inquiry led most intelligence community agencies to conclude -- with varying levels of confidence -- that it was "very unlikely" a foreign adversary was responsible for the health issues reported by American personnel. Global Affairs, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the RCMP subsequently met to discuss the U.S. council's findings. The RCMP indicated that "since no criminality was uncovered, its criminal investigation would be concluded," and CSIS advised it also would be wrapping up its investigations for similar reasons, the Global Affairs report says. Overall, the Canadian efforts "have not uncovered a clear common cause of the symptoms experienced by government of Canada employees," the report adds. "Canada's findings are aligned with the conclusions of the United States on their various health studies and the security report published by the National Intelligence Council." Miller points to other research and testimony that challenge those findings. Lawyer Mark Zaid, representing several U.S. personnel with symptoms, told a congressional hearing in May 2024 there was intelligence, scientific and medical evidence substantiating the reports of anomalous health incidents, and that some were caused by a foreign adversary. Zaid, who had authorized access to secret details, said he was convinced that "the evidence that exists in the classified arena directly contradicts the public conclusions" provided by U.S. federal agencies about the cause of the health symptoms. Global Affairs says it stands by the findings of its 2024 report. Department spokesperson John Babcock said the foreign ministry continues to support the Canadian diplomats and their dependants. "For privacy and security reasons, Global Affairs Canada cannot comment on the specifics of the ongoing investigations, individual cases, nor on specific security measures," he said in an emailed response to questions. "We cannot provide further comment on this matter as it is before the courts." Internal Global Affairs notes -- prepared last year to help answer questions about the department's report -- say the unexplained health incidents "highlighted the challenges of providing responsive health care to diplomats and their families in the context of unforeseen crisis situations abroad." The notes, obtained through the Access to Information Act, say the department had initiated a "thorough review" of the department's overseas health program for employees and their dependants in missions around the world.

2. Trump's takeover of Washington law enforcement faces anger, pushback and protests - Medicine Hat News

WASHINGTON -- Members of the United States National Guard stood near the Washington Monument on Saturday amid escalating tensions in the U.S. capital as President Donald Trump ramped up the presence of law enforcement in the mostly Democratic city. Tourists walking by the uniformed troops in Washington's blistering weekend heat were confused about their presence, with a group from Kentucky asking why the troops were even there. Some families requested photos with the troops and the National Guard members obliged. The sight of army-fatigued National Guard members and face-covered police agents has increased in Washington throughout the week after Trump signed an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the nation's capital. Many residents of Washington are outraged by Trump's overreach, with scores taking to the streets on Saturday to protest the president's takeover. People held signs that read "Hands off DC" and "Dump Trump" while chanting "Trump must go" as they walked toward the White House. Autumn Tustin, holding a sign that said "No ICE! No National Guard!" said it was important to show up for the demonstration outside the White House because other people don't feel safe coming out to push against Trump's agenda to take over the capital. "Being part of a movement feels like the best thing we can do at this point," she told The Canadian Press. Tustin said sometimes it feels like "frogs in a boiling pot of water," where there are a lot of ongoing changes that have huge consequences down the road. She has seen several National Guard members in tourist areas, describing it as "bizarre" and a "waste of talent and money." On Saturday, West Virginia, Ohio and South Carolina authorized hundreds of additional National Guard members to head to Washington. "West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital," West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said. Hundreds of federal law enforcement officers from agencies such as the Secret Service and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement have also fanned across the city. Social media platforms have since filled with videos and pictures of federal agents descending on neighbourhoods -- apprehending delivery drivers, dismantling homeless camps and approaching people on the city's public transportation system and in local parks. One viral video showed a man hurling a sandwich at a federal law-enforcement official. Following the incident, sandwich-thrower Sean Charles Dunn was fired from his job in the U.S. Justice Department and charged with a felony. Trump's takeover has caused outrage from Washington residents but there's little city leaders are able to do to stop it. The District of Columbia is uniquely controlled by the federal government and local leaders are obliged to co-operate with Trump's order. Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, in a letter to residents, said the city's "limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now." Trump on Monday claimed he had to take the action because crime "is getting worse, not getting better," even as police data shows that violence in the capital city is falling. Washington has been plagued by violent crime, particularly during drug epidemics of the 1980s and early 1990s. There was a spike in violent crime again in 2023 but it plummeted the following year and has declined again so far in 2025. Much of the National Guard presence in Washington appears symbolic, with members roasting in the summer heat near national monuments and museums. Other law enforcement agencies, however, have descended throughout the city, evoking anger and fear in many local residents. There's been a clear increase in police presence in neighbourhoods like the dense and diverse Columbia Heights, and on Friday night in entertainment districts like U Street, 14th Street and 16th Street, north of the White House. It's less clear how much, if any, policing has increased in areas in the southeast that have higher crime rates. Trump was at his Virginia golf club Saturday. -- With files from The Associated Press This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 16, 2025. Kelly Geraldine Malone, The Canadian Press


3. Apple Watch blood oxygen feature returns: Stunning update rolls out with iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1. How can you access it?

Apple will introduce a redesigned Blood Oxygen feature for some Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users through an iPhone and Apple Watch software update, the tech giant said on Thursday. The feature typically allows users to see a readout of their blood oxygen level right on the Apple Watch.

Tech giant Apple is bringing blood oxygen detection back to its latest smartwatches after the company was forced to stop offering the feature on US models over a patent dispute. The blood oxygen feature will come to Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Ultra 2 models in the US currently missing the functionality through a software update, the company said in a statement. This feature is meant to help people understand their respiratory health.

Apple is rolling out a software update that enables a redesigned version of the feature for the Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 that circumvents the import ban imposed by the International Trade Commission. To get around the ban, blood oxygen data collected on the Apple Watch will now be measured and calculated on the iPhone that it is paired to. While users won't be able to view the data on their wrist, they'll be able to view it in the iPhone's Health app under the Respiratory section.

iOS 18.6.1 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update. watchOS 11.6.1 is available for newer Apple Watch models that have blood oxygen monitoring disabled, and it can be downloaded through the Apple Watch app on the iPhone.

This marks the latest development in a years-long saga that saw Apple temporarily yank its popular smartwatches from US store shelves during the critical holiday season nearly two years ago. In 2023, the International Trade Commission ruled that Apple had violated a patent from digital health company Masimo related to its pulse oximeter technology, which Apple denied strongly.

When the order was issued, it applied only to new Apple Watches in the United States, meaning those who already owned an Apple Watch with the feature were unaffected. Apple Watches sold outside the United States were also unaffected by the order.

Now, Apple has found a workaround and is restoring it through the new iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 updates. Apple's decision to release the update follows a fresh US Customs ruling that allows the company to import watches with a redesigned version of the technology.

Users with models Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the US who currently do not have the Blood Oxygen feature will have access to the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature by updating their paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and their Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1.

Following this update, sensor data from the Blood Oxygen app on Apple Watch will be measured and calculated on the paired iPhone, and results can be viewed in the Respiratory section of the Health app, the company said. This update was enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling.

There will be no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch units purchased outside of the U.S.

In the US, users of these Apple Watch models who don't currently have the Blood Oxygen feature can get the redesigned version by updating their iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1.

With the latest update, the Blood Oxygen app on Apple Watch now sends its data to the paired iPhone for processing. The results will be displayed in the Health app under the Respiratory section. This change comes in response to a US Customs ruling. In simple terms, Apple Watch users in the US can once again measure their blood oxygen levels directly on their watch, but the detailed results will only appear on the iPhone. Watches that were sold with the original feature, or those purchased outside the US, remain unaffected.


4. How Crypto Diplomacy Boosts Pakistan's Importance in Washington?

*Web Desk:* According to the British newspaper *Financial Times*, Pakistan's recent crypto initiatives have significantly increased its importance in Washington and opened new avenues for investment.

The report highlights that the strategic vision of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, combined with crypto-driven measures, has earned Pakistan recognition in U.S. policy circles. The Asia Pacific Foundation noted that relations between the United States and Pakistan have witnessed an unexpected improvement and reached a new high.

*Financial Times* revealed that ties between the Trump administration and Islamabad are warming, while India has expressed dissatisfaction over the development. Through what analysts describe as "crypto diplomacy," Pakistan has managed to secure space within Trump's business inner circles.

In a major breakthrough, World Liberty Financial signed a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council. This agreement sets the stage for the tokenization of Pakistan's vast mineral resources, estimated to be worth trillions of dollars.

Bilal Bin Saqib, Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, participated in key trade negotiations in Washington, where Pakistan's crypto potential was effectively showcased before Trump's close associates and U.S. advisors.

The reception in Washington has been positive, with American officials and business leaders showing strong interest in Pakistan's crypto projects. Analysts believe this could pave the way for significant foreign investment in the country.


5. MMJ International Holdings: President Trump's Marijuana Fix? DEA's Program Exposed: Promises Made, Promises Not Kept

"As President Trump weighs marijuana rescheduling in the coming weeks, the DEA's track record reveals years of mismanagement, empty promises, and patients left waiting," stated MMJ CEO Duane Boise.

WASHINGTON, D.C. / ACCESS Newswire / August 17, 2025 / President Trump's decision to potentially reschedule marijuana is the first serious step in decades to break through the bureaucratic logjam that has kept patients and scientists waiting. For years, the DEA has promised a functional marijuana research program. For years, those promises have been broken.

DEA's Promises on Paper

In its Final Rule (85 Fed. Reg. 82333, Dec. 18, 2020), the DEA pledged that marijuana manufacturing licenses would be tied to FDA science and genuine medical research. The agency declared:

"DEA will evaluate each application... to determine whether the applicant's proposed activities... will promote medical research."

"DEA will require applicants to demonstrate bona fide supply agreements with researchers authorized by the FDA to conduct clinical research."

"DEA's goal is to ensure that the United States has a sufficient supply of marihuana to meet the legitimate medical, scientific, and research needs of the United States."

These were the promises.

The Harsh Reality

But DEA's actions told a different story:

Licenses granted to companies with no FDA INDs, no clinical trial protocols, and no scientific foundation.

No bona fide supply agreements with FDA-authorized researchers - a direct violation of DEA's own Final Rule.

Four years later, there is still no adequate, federally compliant supply of cannabis for clinical trials, leaving patients with Huntington's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and other conditions waiting.

The only company that meets DEA's own published criteria - MMJ BioPharma, with two FDA-filed INDs and an Orphan Drug Designation - has been stalled while non-scientific registrants received licenses.

Promises Made, Promises Not Kept

DEA's marijuana program has been a case study in mismanagement:

Rules written, then ignored.

Patients promised access, then denied it.

Science promised priority, then sidelined.

President Trump's possible rescheduling decision shines a spotlight on this failure. By moving marijuana to Schedule III, he has forced the issue back into the open and made clear that real reform will require DEA accountability.

The Path Forward

Patients deserve more than empty promises. They deserve consistent, reproducible, FDA-approved medicines. They deserve agencies that follow their own rules. And they deserve leadership that keeps its word.

With rescheduling now on the table, it is time to hold DEA to account for the gap between its promises and its performance. President Trump has taken the first step - now the DEA must be compelled to deliver.

MMJ is represented by attorney Megan Sheehan.

1. [Finlight] Syria‚Äôs al-Sharaa calls for unity, accuses Israel of fuelling unrest in south

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks during a joint press conference with French President after a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on May 7, 2025.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has said the battle to unify his country after years of civil war "should not be with blood", rejecting any partition and accusing Israel of meddling in the south.

His remarks, released by state TV on Sunday, came as hundreds demonstrated in south Syria's Sweida province, denouncing sectarian violence last month and calling for the right to self-determination for the Druze-majority province.

"We still have another battle ahead of us to unify Syria, and it should not be with blood and military force... it should be through some kind of understanding because Syria is tired of war," Sharaa said during a dialogue session involving notables from the northwest province of Idlib and other senior officials.

"I do not see Syria as at risk of division. Some people desire a process of dividing Syria and trying to establish cantons... this matter is impossible," he said according to a recording of the meeting, distributed overnight by state media.

"Some parties seek to gain power through regional power, Israel or others. This is also extremely difficult and cannot be implemented," he said.

At the protest in Sweida, some demonstrators waved the Israeli flag and called for self-determination for the region.

A week of bloodshed in Sweida began on July 13 with clashes between Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin, but rapidly escalated, drawing in government forces, with Israel also carrying out strikes.

Syrian authorities have said their forces intervened to stop the clashes, but witnesses, Druze factions and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have accused them of siding with the Bedouin and committing abuses against the Druze, including summary executions.

Sharaa said that Sweida "witnessed many violations from all sides... some members of the security forces and army in Syria also carried out some violations".

The state is required "to hold all perpetrators of violations to account", whatever their affiliation, he added.

"Israel is intervening directly in Sweida, seeking to implement policies aimed at weakening the state in general or finding excuses to interfere in ongoing policies in the southern region," Sharaa said.

Israel, which has its own Druze community, has said it has acted to defend the minority group as well as enforce its demands for the demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Syria's new authorities are also in talks with a semi-autonomous Kurdish administration that runs swathes of the country's north and northeast and has called for decentralisation, which Damascus has rejected.

Implementation of a March 10 deal on integrating the Kurds' semi-autonomous civil and military institutions into the state has been held up by differences between the parties.

"We are now discussing the mechanisms for implementation" of the deal, Sharaa said.

2. [Finlight] Rayner says Farage ‚Äòfailing young women‚Äô with plan to scrap Online Safety Act

Nigel Farage is ‚Äúfailing a generation of young women‚Äù with his plans to scrap the Online Safety Act, Angela Rayner has said, arguing the move would cause an increase in the prevalence of ‚Äúrevenge porn‚Äù.

The comments by the deputy prime minister are the latest criticism of Farage from the government, with Labour launching a parallel series of attack adverts on the Reform UK leader, including one showing him alongside the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate.

In a press conference at the end of last month, Reform promised to scrap the act, which had just come into force, saying measures intended to push social media companies to limit false and potentially harmful content would instead bring censorship and make the UK ‚Äúa borderline dystopian state‚Äù.

In response, the science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, accused Farage of being on the side of child abusers such as Jimmy Savile, bringing a furious response from the Reform leader.

In comments to the Sunday Telegraph, Rayner highlighted what she said would be the risks of getting rid of the act in terms of clamping down on what is formally known as intimate image abuse, where offenders either upload intimate pictures or footage of others or else share them via other means.

‚ÄúIntimate image abuse is a devastating crime and contributes to a vile misogynistic culture on social media that we know translates into physical spaces too,‚Äù Rayner told the paper.

‚ÄúNigel Farage risks failing a generation of young women with his dangerous and irresponsible plans to scrap online safety laws. Scrapping safeguards and having no viable alternative plan in place to halt the floodgates of abuse that could open is an appalling dereliction of duty.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Farage to tell women and girls across Britain how he would keep them safe online.‚Äù

Labour is launching a linked series of online adverts against Farage, including one published on Sunday morning connected to Rayner‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúNigel Farage wants to make it easier to share revenge porn online,‚Äù it says, alongside an image of Farage grinning.

According to the Sunday Times, another advert will highlight Farage‚Äôs comments about Tate, the influencer who, along with his brother, Tristan, faces charges in the UK including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.

The two British Americans are under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges that they deny.

The Labour advert shows Farage with Andrew Tate and the headline: ‚ÄúNigel Farage says Andrew Tate is an ‚Äòimportant voice‚Äô for men.‚Äù The comments come from an interview Farage did on the Strike It Big podcast last year.

Laila Cunningham, a former magistrate who has joined Reform, wrote a Telegraph article on Saturday in which she called the Online Safety Act ‚Äúcensorship laws‚Äù, saying laws already existed to combat ‚Äùrevenge porn‚Äù.

4. [Finlight] Will Trump‚Äôs tariffs get ‚Äôtariffried‚Äô by the courts?

Investing.com --¬†The Trump administration is bracing for a potential legal setback that could undermine its tariff strategy, analysts at Yardeni Research highlighted in a note this week.¬†
The firm stated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., may soon rule that President Donald Trump lacks the legal authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
Yardeni noted that concern was evident in an August 11 letter from two of the administration‚Äôs top lawyers to the court clerk, filed after oral arguments on July 31, where judges reportedly pressed the government on the tariffs‚Äô legality.¬†
The letter warns that ‚Äúsuddenly revoking the President‚Äôs tariff authority under IEEPA would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,‚Äù adding it could ‚Äúlead to a 1929-style result.‚Äù
While Yardeni said the conclusion ‚Äúmay be exaggerated,‚Äù the fallout would still be ‚Äúmessy,‚Äù with foreign governments potentially ignoring trade agreements and companies seeking tariff refunds from the Treasury.
Trump has promoted tariffs as an ‚ÄúExternal Revenue Service‚Äù to help cut the federal deficit.¬†
Customs duties hit a record $157 billion over the 12 months through July, and Trump has aimed for a base tariff of 10%-15% on all U.S. trading partners, potentially yielding over $500 billion annually.
Losing the case could raise bond yields and pressure stocks due to renewed policy uncertainty, according to Yardeni.
The firm cited Capital Alpha Partners‚Äô Jim Lucier, who expects a Federal Circuit decision by late August or September.
¬†A unanimous ruling against the administration could give the Supreme Court cover to avoid the case and decline a stay that would keep the tariffs in place.


5. [Finlight] Wells Fargo outlines how the Fed may revisit its policy framework at Jackson Hole

Investing.com -¬†Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to go over how the U.S. economy and the central bank‚Äôs policy setting has evolved over the course of his tenure at a closely-watched event in Wyoming later this month, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.
Powell previously used his address at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in 2020 to lay out changes to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs policy framework. Some five years later, that outline is now set to reach its conclusion.
In a note, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Sarah House noted that in the decade leading up to the FOMC‚Äôs prior framework review, the economic environment was dominated by persistently low inflation and excess labor market slack. The Fed has been tasked with using its policies options to keep inflation stable and securing maximum employment.¬†
"The adjustments made in 2020 at the height of the pandemic reflected these perceived asymmetric risks to the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate," the analysts wrote.
However, in the time since then, the macroeconomic backdrop has changed drastically. Powered by pandemic-era shocks, inflation charged past 2% in March 2021 and has not returned to that rate -- the Fed‚Äôs target level -- since. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to less than 4% by the end of that same year. It now stands at 4.2%.
"Much of the past few years have been marked by U.S. monetary policymakers facing an old but new problem: overheated labor markets and above-target inflation," the analysts wrote.
Against this backdrop, they do not anticipate that the Fed will unveil any major changes to its toolkit as part of this year‚Äôs review, with the key federal funds rate likely to stay the main device the central bank can utilize to respond to broader trends in employment and inflation.
The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet may also be "de-emphasized" as a policy tool "for the time being," they added. Powell is anticipated to review how the FOMC approaches policy communication later this year as well.
Generally, the strategists said the new framework will likely "codify" what is already the Fed‚Äôs "modus operandi" -- a more "symmetric" approach to its inflation and employment objectives.
"Yet, the shift away from the asymmetric risks around low inflation and maximum employment marks an important departure from the psychology of the 2008-2020 period, and it could result in more preemptive policy tightening when the next inflationary episode occurs," they said.

1. Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems - SiliconANGLE

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.
