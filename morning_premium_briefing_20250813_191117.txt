Good morning. Thursday, August twenty-first. Futures are mixed. Cisco (ticker C-S-C-O) reported strong guidance but shares are down. Block (ticker X-Y-Z) is up after debt offering. Google antitrust decision looms. Watch for tech volatility today.


Looking at today's economic calendar, traders should brace for potential volatility, particularly during the early morning hours. Australia kicks things off at one thirty A-M Eastern with employment data. The Employment Change figure for July is anticipated to show an increase of twenty-five thousand jobs, significantly higher than the previous two thousand.

Simultaneously, the Unemployment Rate is projected to dip to four point two percent, a slight improvement from the previous four point three percent. Strong employment figures typically support the Australian dollar, ticker A-U-D, while a weaker-than-expected report could lead to selling pressure. Expect heightened volatility around this release.

At six A-M Eastern, Germany released Consumer Price Index data for July, matching estimates exactly at point three percent, up from the previous reading of zero percent. This inline figure is unlikely to cause major market ripples.

Keep an eye on medium-impact German Wholesale Price data, but the Australian employment numbers are likely to be the main market movers today. Be prepared for choppy trading conditions, especially in A-U-D currency pairs, as the market digests the labor data. Position yourselves accordingly and manage risk carefully.


Good morning. As we approach the opening bell, futures are signaling a cautiously optimistic start. S and P futures are up slightly, while Nasdaq futures show a more muted gain. Dow futures are also trading higher, bolstered by overnight strength in overseas markets. Asian markets closed mixed, influencing pre-market sentiment.

Pre-market volume is moderate, suggesting a measured approach from traders this morning. Keep an eye on implied open levels to gauge potential opening ranges.

Notable pre-market movers include Miami International Holdings, ticker M-I-A-X, set to begin trading today after pricing their I-P-O above expectations at twenty-three dollars per share. This successful I-P-O may signal renewed investor appetite for financial markets technology. Monitor ticker M-I-A-X's initial performance closely for broader market sentiment cues. The company, which operates multiple exchanges, including M-I-A-X Pearl and M-I-A-X Futures Exchange, is expected to close the offering tomorrow, subject to closing conditions.

Yesterday saw a mixed close, with the ticker D-O-W -- Jones Industrial Average edging slightly higher, while the S and P five hundred and NASDAQ composite closed marginally lower, reflecting ongoing concerns about inflation and interest rate hikes.

The Nikkei closed down point eight percent. European markets are currently trading mixed, with the F-T-S-E in London showing slight gains while the D-A-X in Frankfurt is down. Key levels broken overnight include the four thousand and one hundred support on S and P futures, suggesting potential further downside.

Watch for the eight thirty A-M E-S-T release of jobless claims, which will provide further insight into the labor market's strength. Traders should also monitor any headlines regarding the debt ceiling negotiations. Consider taking profits on long positions if the S and P five hundred retraces to four thousand.
