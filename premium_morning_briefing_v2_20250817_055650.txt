1. Zelensky claims Russia 'complicating' ceasefire efforts as PM meets allies

Russia is complicating efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to meet with European leaders to discuss the war.

The coalition of the willing, the alliance which is planning to police a future peace deal in Ukraine, will meet on Sunday afternoon amid reports Donald Trump favours a Russian land grab to end the war.

Following the Alaska summit between Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin on Friday, the American leader suggested he wants to move straight to a full peace deal, rather than negotiating a ceasefire first.

The shift in Mr Trump's position appears to echo the Russians' refusal to agree to ceasefire before engaging in peace talks.

Several news outlets have cited sources which claimed that during the negotiations Mr Putin demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops.

Other outlets reported that Mr Trump is inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelensky about it when they meet in the Oval Office.

Writing on social media on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian leader railed against Russia's refusal to lay down arms temporarily before agreeing to end the war.

Mr Zelensky said: "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing.

"This complicates the situation."

He added: "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades.

"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war."

The Prime Minister, alongside French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz, will host the coalition of the willing on Sunday afternoon.

The video conference will see allies who plan to keep the peace in Ukraine gather ahead of Mr Zelensky's visit to Washington on Monday.

The Ukrainian leader is expected to attend the Sunday afternoon video call, which is scheduled to take place at 2pm UK time.

Friday's summit between Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, ended without any commitment towards a ceasefire.

The Russian president described it as "timely" and "useful" after he left.

Mr Trump afterwards suggested it was time for Mr Zelensky to make a deal to end the war.

Sir Keir commended Mr Trump's "pursuit of an end to the killing", but insisted Ukraine's leader must not be excluded from future talks to broker a peace in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister and European leaders appeared increasingly confident that Mr Trump will offer a "security guarantee" of air support to back up allied troops on the ground in Ukraine, should they be deployed to keep the peace.

Experts have warned the face-to-face summit has risked legitimising the Russian leader, who has been made a pariah by the international community for invading Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky has warned Russia may ramp up its strikes against his country in the coming days "in order to create more favourable political circumstances for talks with global actors".


2. Trump's Victory, Bitcoin Surges Past $76,000, and the Decline of Hamster Kombat | ForkLog

"Should Have Bought" is a news podcast by the ForkLog editorial team covering the week's main industry events and the hottest tokens.

Topics: Trump's victory, Bitcoin hits a new ATH above $76,000, Polymarket faces scrutiny from French authorities, and Pavel Durov introduces new features for Telegram mini-apps.

Special guest: crypto investor and founder of the Telegram channel "24 Words," Artem Tolkachev.

Participants: ForkLog authors Lena Jess and Alex K.

Donald Trump has become the 47th President of the United States, defeating Kamala Harris of the Democratic Party in the election. The inauguration is set for January 20, 2025, with Senator J.D. Vance as Vice President.

During his campaign, Trump expressed support for the crypto industry, promised to strengthen the US's role as a "crypto capital," and vowed to dismiss the head of the SEC, among other pledges.

Analysts note that his victory has boosted optimism in the digital asset market, predicting a potential rise in Bitcoin's price to $80,000 by year's end, contrasting with a potential price drop had Harris won.

Amid the news from the US, the price of the leading cryptocurrency broke the $75,000 mark on November 6, setting a new all-time high. The price continued to climb, surpassing $76,000. Following Bitcoin, most other digital assets entered the "green zone."

On November 7, the US Federal Reserve predictably lowered the key rate range by 25 basis points to 4.5-4.75% per annum. The cryptocurrency market reacted cautiously: digital gold held above $76,000, and many altcoins showed slight growth.

Telegram founder Pavel Durov announced 10 new features for the messenger's mini-apps, including full-screen mode, shortcuts, access to geolocation, media sharing, and ad monetization.

The innovations aim to expand developers' capabilities and enable the creation of dozens of new apps and games in the popular messenger. Some features are already active, with the rest promised to launch within a couple of weeks.

Additionally, TON Accelerator and Mantle announced a $5 million initiative to foster cross-chain innovations between TON and EVM networks, providing participants with development support and market entry strategies.

The Telegram clicker Hamster Kombat lost a significant portion of its active audience following what users deemed an unsuccessful airdrop. The number of players dropped from 300 million to 40.9 million, and the price of HMSTR plummeted from $0.011 to $0.002431 since listing, according to CoinGecko.

The community reacted negatively to the postponements of trading start dates on major exchanges and the exclusion of most players from the airdrop. Out of 300 million users, only 131 million received tokens; another 2.3 million accounts were blocked on suspicion of cheating.


3. J-K: Kathua Cloudburst: Army Deploys Troops, Resources To Help In Rescue Operation

New Delhi: The Indian Army was at the forefront of the relief and rescue operation on Sunday in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district, where four people were killed and many were injured in flash floods triggered by a cloudburst in the Ghati area.

Army's Rising Star Corps said on X, "Indian army Columns on the ground in #Kathua -- rescuing families, giving hope, food &amp; care after the #Cloudburst".

The Army also posted pictures of its soldiers helping with the rescue of injured people, shifting them to safety so that they can be evacuated on time for medical attention.

Meanwhile, Nagrota headquartered White Knight Corps also said on X, "In the aftermath of a cloud burst at #ChisotiVillage, #Kishtwar, troops of #WhiteKnightCorps swiftly mobilised for rescue & relief ops. Efforts are centred on safeguarding lives and aiding survivors. Search for the missing continues. Relief stores, medical teams, and rescue gear rushed to the site. We Serve, We Protect."

Union Minister Dr Jitendra Singh informed that helicopters have been pressed into service for the timely evacuation of the injured people from the disaster site to the hospitals.

Dr Jitendra Singh has posted an update on the Kathua cloudburst, saying on X that helicopter services have been arranged for shifting the injured to appropriate hospitals.

"6 injured have been airlifted for hospitalisation in Mamoon, Pathankot, which was found to be relatively nearer the destination. DIG Police, Sh Shiv Kumar Sharma, along with his team, is camping at the spot and is in constant touch with me. Further assistance will be arranged, as and when required," he wrote on X.

Earlier today, Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to J&K L-G and CM, assuring all support from the Central government in the relief and rescue operation underway in Kathua.

He said on X, "Spoke with the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir regarding the cloudburst in Kathua. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out by the local administration, and NDRF teams have also been rushed to the site.

"Assured every support from the Modi government. We stand firmly behind our sisters and brothers of J&K," he said.

At least four people were killed and many others injured after a cloudburst hit Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district during the night intervening Saturday and Sunday, said officials here, adding that a rescue operation is now underway in the affected area.

Dr Jitendra Singh was the first to post the news about the Kathua cloudburst when he said on X, "Spoken to SSP Kathua Sh Shobhit Saxena after receiving information about a cloud burst in the Janglote area. 4 Casualties reported. In addition, damage has occurred to the Railway track and the national Highway, while the Police Station in Kathua has been affected."

CM Omar Abdullah's office said that the Chief Minister has expressed grief over the tragic loss of lives and damage caused by landslides in several parts of District Kathua, including Jodh Khad and Juthana, which claimed 4 lives and left many injured.

"He conveyed heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured, and assured all necessary assistance. Chief Minister has directed the administration to carry out immediate relief, rescue, and evacuation measures to ensure the safety and support of affected families," the CMO said.

The district administration issued a weather advisory and said "heavy to very heavy rainfall" is reported across the district. It also requested the public to stay away from water bodies.

This is the second cloudburst to hit Jammu and Kashmir during the last four days.

On August 14, a massive cloudburst hit the Chashoti village in the Padder sub-division of Kishtwar district. So far, 65 bodies have been recovered, and over 100 people have been rescued in the Chashoti cloudburst disaster.

Meanwhile, 75 people have been reported missing by their families, although locals and eyewitnesses claim that hundreds may have been swept away by flash floods and buried under giant boulders, logs, and rubble. Among the deceased were two personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and a Special Police Officer (SPO) of the local police, the officials added.

The disaster struck Chashoti, the last motorable village en route to the Machail Mata temple.

Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info

A Lancashire artist who has had works exhibited at galleries across the world, including in London and Rome, is set to brighten up the streets of Morecambe.

Abigail Hampsey, who describes herself as "a working-class painter", is the first artist announced in the second stage of a project by Morecambe Business Improvement District (BID) creating public artworks around the town.

Beginning in August, this is the second stage of the scheme, which has already seen a number of eye-catching murals created in the town centre. The BID said the project is aimed to "celebrate local heritage, attract visitors, and create a more vibrant environment for residents and businesses".

Born in Lancashire, Abigail studied Fine Art at Newcastle University and then Painting at the Royal College of Art. Her work has been exhibited in London - including at the prestigious Saatchi Gallery - as well as locations in Manchester, Newcastle, and Rome.

Among accolades she has received are the Basil H. Alkazzi Scholarship Award in Painting at the Royal College of Art. In 2025, she became the first recipient of The Rebecca Scott Residency for an artist living and working in the North West at the British School at Rome, where she spent January to March of this year.

She is also a painting tutor, a baker, a business owner, and a member of the Contemporary British Painting Collective.

John O'Neill, Morecambe BID manager, said: "Public art projects like these do more than brighten our streets - they tell our story, inspire pride, and give people another reason to visit and enjoy our town. We're proud to support local artists and create a legacy that will be enjoyed for years to come."

Over the coming weeks, more artists will join Abigail in transforming walls and spaces around Morecambe. Locations, designs, and progress updates will be shared on Morecambe BID's social media channels.

A Business Improvement District, or BID, is a group of companies within a specific area, usually a town centre, aimed at improving and promoting the area within which they work.

1. Trump's Victory, Bitcoin Surges Past $76,000, and the Decline of Hamster Kombat | ForkLog

"Should Have Bought" is a news podcast by the ForkLog editorial team covering the week's main industry events and the hottest tokens.

Topics: Trump's victory, Bitcoin hits a new ATH above $76,000, Polymarket faces scrutiny from French authorities, and Pavel Durov introduces new features for Telegram mini-apps.

2. China's early South American soybean buys squeeze US out of peak export window

China has moved early to lock in soybean supplies from Brazil for September and October, sidelining US exporters from what is traditionally their most lucrative selling period.

The shift underscores Beijing's growing trade reliance on South America and comes amid renewed political and commercial tensions with Washington.

According to market analysis from Brazil's Safras & Mercado, traders reported Chinese purchases of roughly 8 million tonnes of soybeans for September and 4 million tonnes for October, about half of the country's projected demand for the two months. All volumes are sourced from South America, with Brazil capturing the lion's share.

The move effectively shortens the US "window" for soybean shipments to China, which typically runs from September to January before the Brazilian harvest arrives.

Last year, China imported 105 million tonnes of soybeans, 22.13 million of them from the US, illustrating how pivotal this early-season slot has been for American farmers.

The decision to buy more soybeans from South America comes as Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures hover near five-year lows, with reduced Chinese buying expected to keep prices under pressure.

When asked about the soybean purchases and their impact on US producers, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, did not directly address the trade volumes.

Instead, he said Bejing hoped "the US side will work with China to implement the important common understandings reached by our heads of state" and called for dialogue "on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit" to promote sustainable bilateral relations.

The Chinese embassy in Brasilia did not respond to requests for comment.

On Monday, US President Donald Trump publicly urged Beijing to quadruple its soybean purchases from the United States, a dramatic call just days before a tariff truce between the two countries was set to expire.

Posting on social media, Trump claimed China was concerned about soybean shortages and said he expected "quick" orders from Beijing. The remarks briefly sent Chicago futures higher, but market watchers quickly questioned whether such a deal was realistic.

Meeting the request would require China to source most of its soybean imports from the United States, an unprecedented shift that would displace established Brazilian volumes.

It remains unclear whether increased Chinese agricultural purchases would be a condition for a lasting trade deal between Beijing and Washington.

In the meantime, China has not booked any US soybeans for the fourth quarter, and some feed manufacturers are reportedly testing alternative suppliers, including Argentina, to secure cheaper South American protein meals.

In Brazil, the news of both the early Chinese commitments and Trump's gambit was met with quiet confidence among exporters.

In a statement, the Brazilian Soybean Producers Association said on Monday that it was monitoring the impact of a potential trade deal on crops, but that the combination of strong September and October sales could be an opportunity to further cement Brazil's role as China's primary supplier.

As the US risks losing ground in the Chinese market, Brazil and China are also working on longer-term trade integration.

On Sunday, the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported that officials from both countries were said to be drafting a bilateral protocol to recognise environmental certifications and traceability systems for key agricultural exports, particularly beef and soybeans.

The plan would align methodologies for measuring emissions, land use and animal welfare, allowing Chinese authorities to formally recognise Brazilian sustainability seals such as "Carbon Neutral Meat" and "Low Carbon Soy". Measures include integrated digital tracking, QR codes linking to environmental data and shared databases.

The protocol aims to smooth trade flows, add value to certified products and pre-empt future non-tariff barriers.

A Chinese technical delegation is expected in Brazil later this year to inspect systems on the ground before finalising the deal.

The talks come against a backdrop of US tariff hikes on Brazilian goods and growing political friction between Washington and Bras√≠lia, even as China expands its list of authorised Brazilian exporters in other sectors, from coffee to processed foods. -- SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST


3. Is the United Kingdom still a powerful country?

Years of political upheaval, anaemic growth and the fallout from Brexit have made many wonder if the UK has slipped into a more modest role. Yet power is not a single measure, and when Britain's military, intelligence, nuclear deterrent and global influence are weighed together, the picture looks more robust than the pessimists allow.

This article is the opinion of the author and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.

The armed forces are smaller than a generation ago, down from more than 200,000 in 2012, yet the equipment they operate is among the most advanced in the world. The Royal Navy sails two modern aircraft carriers and fields, sometimes, Astute-class attack submarines, with Dreadnought ballistic missile submarines under construction to replace the Vanguard fleet. The RAF flies Typhoon and F-35 jets and is experimenting with uncrewed systems that will play a larger role in the coming decade.

Defence spending remains significant. At more than $80 billion in 2024 for our American readers, Britain ranks among the top six globally. That is dwarfed by the United States and China, but it compares favourably with France and is higher than most other NATO allies. Successive governments have promised to move the budget towards 2.5 or even 3 per cent of GDP, though fiscal pressures will make that difficult to deliver in practice.

Nuclear weapons continue to anchor Britain's strategic position. Since 1969 the country has maintained a submarine on patrol at all times, ensuring an independent deterrent. The stockpile is smaller than those of other nuclear states, but its credibility is not in doubt. With the Dreadnought programme moving ahead, Britain will retain this status well into the 2030s and beyond. Only a handful of countries can claim the same.

Intelligence is another source of weight. MI6, MI5 and GCHQ remain central to the global security architecture. The Five Eyes partnership provides access to information streams that most nations simply do not see. In cyber security, the National Cyber Security Centre has given Britain a central hub for countering digital threats, and industry assessments regularly place the UK near the top of the global rankings. These assets, though often invisible to the public, underpin both national defence and international standing.

Soft power adds a further layer. The reach of the English language, the global presence of British universities, and the continuing role of the BBC give the UK a cultural footprint far larger than its size. London remains one of the world's leading financial centres. The Commonwealth provides diplomatic links across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. And Britain continues to hold a seat at the top tables of international politics through NATO, the G7 and the UN Security Council.

All of this is balanced by constraints that cannot be ignored. The economy has been sluggish, growing just over one per cent last year, and productivity has struggled since the financial crisis. Debt, inflation and pressure on public services squeeze government spending. In global terms, Britain's share of economic output is far lower than it was in the mid-20th century, and sheer manpower is not what it once was.

Yet the overall balance remains clear. Britain is not a superpower on the scale of the United States or China, but it is not a minor player either. Its nuclear arsenal, advanced military, world-class intelligence agencies and extensive diplomatic network put it in a category of its own alongside France, and ahead of most peers. When combined with cultural reach and the capacity to operate alongside allies, these factors ensure that Britain still counts in 2025.

The question is less whether the country is powerful than how it chooses to use that power. The resources exist to play a significant role in global affairs, but they require sustained investment and clear political direction. Britain's influence is no longer guaranteed by default; it must be maintained through choices made at home.

If those choices are made wisely, the UK will continue to matter in the world for decades to come.


4. Egypt reaffirms rejection of escalation in Gaza, decries 'Greater Israel' statements - Egypt Independent

CAIRO, Aug 15 (MENA) - Minister of Foreign Affairs, Emigration and Egyptian Expatriates Badr Abdelatty reaffirmed Egypt's categorical rejection of the ongoing Israeli military escalation in Gaza, the recent expansion of settlement activity in the West Bank, and inflammatory statements advocating the so-called "Greater Israel."

He stressed that such actions only serve to inflame tensions, escalate conflict, and undermine regional stability.

The remarks came during a phone call on Friday between Abdelatty and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas.

The phone call was held in line with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's directives to intensify international efforts toward securing a ceasefire in Gaza and facilitating urgent humanitarian assistance.

They engaged in a comprehensive discussion on the latest political, security, and humanitarian developments in the Gaza Strip.

Abdelatty stressed the urgent need to establish a credible political horizon that paves the way for a just and sustainable resolution to the Palestinian issue, one that ensures the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state.

Abdelatty reaffirmed Egypt's ongoing efforts to mediate a ceasefire and underscored the need for stronger international engagement, particularly from the European Union (EU), to help end hostilities and guarantee the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid.

He placed full responsibility on Israel, as the occupying power, for keeping Gaza's five border crossings closed, calling for their immediate reopening and the removal of all obstacles hindering the flow of urgent humanitarian and medical assistance, measures he described as contributing to a deliberate policy of starvation.

During the phone call, Abdelatty briefed the EU official on Egypt's intensive efforts, in coordination with Qatar and the United States, to reach a comprehensive agreement ensuring a ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access, and a hostage-prisoner swap, involving the release of hostages and a number of Palestinian detainees.

The call also addressed Egypt's preparations to host an international conference in Cairo on early recovery and reconstruction in Gaza, set to take place immediately after a ceasefire is achieved.

The conference is being organized in coordination with regional and international partners, including the EU.

For her part, the EU high representative praised Egypt's sustained efforts to de-escalate the situation and secure a ceasefire, as well as its key role in alleviating the unbearable suffering of the Palestinian people by facilitating the delivery of aid.

She expressed the EU's readiness to participate in the Gaza reconstruction conference and work closely with Egypt to ensure unhindered humanitarian access and the success of efforts exerted to achieve a ceasefire. (MENA)


5. U.S. Tourism Drives Scottsdale's Economic Growth Surpassing Three Billion Dollars In 2024

Scottsdale, Arizona, experienced an exceptional economic surge in 2024, with a nearly $4 billion influx into its economy, according to new reports published by the city's tourism and events division. This remarkable growth was primarily driven by the city's thriving tourism sector, which continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the local economy. The city welcomed more than 11 million visitors, who collectively contributed an impressive $3.7 billion in economic output. Of these visitors, 1.7 million were international travelers who stayed overnight, underscoring Scottsdale's global appeal and its status as a key destination for international tourism.

The city's growth in tourism was not limited to international guests. Scottsdale saw an increase of over 300,000 visitors compared to 2023, marking a notable rise in both overnight stays and day trips. International tourists alone accounted for a growth of more than 127,000 visitors, highlighting the growing global interest in Scottsdale as a premier destination. This surge is indicative of the city's ability to cater to both leisure and business travelers, establishing it as one of the top destinations for visitors from across the U.S. and beyond.

A significant portion of the revenue generated from tourism was directed toward local businesses, further emphasizing the positive impact of the influx of tourists. Retail shops in Scottsdale saw a substantial boost in sales, with 55% of overnight visitors choosing to shop at locally owned businesses. Day-trip visitors showed an even greater inclination toward supporting local commerce, with 59% of them opting to make purchases from Scottsdale-based shops. This pattern of local spending not only benefits the city's economy but also strengthens the local business community, helping them thrive in an increasingly competitive tourism market.

Among the key drivers of Scottsdale's tourism success is WestWorld, the city's largest indoor/outdoor venue. Between October 2023 and June 2024, WestWorld generated nearly $163.6 million in tourism-related revenue, becoming a central hub for major events that attract thousands of visitors annually. These events, along with others like the WM Phoenix Open and the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Auction, continue to play a vital role in drawing both national and international crowds to Scottsdale. This ongoing influx of visitors from across the U.S. and abroad further cements Scottsdale's reputation as a sought-after destination for high-profile events.

The city's robust economic growth can also be attributed to the strength of its tourism brand. Rachel Sacco, the president and CEO of Experience Scottsdale, pointed out that the year-over-year growth in tourism demonstrates the enduring strength of Scottsdale's brand, which continues to attract millions of visitors from across the United States and around the world. This growth, paired with a diverse range of activities and events, helps keep Scottsdale at the forefront of travelers' minds.

Despite a slight decrease in the percentage of domestic overnight visitors staying in resorts and hotels -- dropping from 87% in 2023 to 79% in 2024 -- Scottsdale's overall hotel occupancy rate remained stable at 65%. This suggests that while some visitors may be exploring alternative lodging options, the city's hotels and resorts still maintain a significant share of overnight stays. This indicates the city's continued ability to offer a wide array of accommodations, appealing to various traveler preferences and budgets.

As part of its commitment to enhancing its tourism infrastructure, Scottsdale has projected an investment of $54.7 million in municipal services for tourists in the 2024-2025 fiscal year. However, the city is set to exceed this investment, with visitor-generated taxes expected to reach $77.5 million, surpassing the projected expenditure by $22.8 million. This impressive tax revenue provides Scottsdale with the means to reinvest in local infrastructure and public services, further enhancing the visitor experience and ensuring that tourism remains a driving force behind the city's economic success.

3. [Finlight] Caribbean looks to revive passion and pride for cricket ‚Äì and for the region

When they toured overseas in the 1970s, West Indies cricketers were sometimes subjected to barrages of racist abuse. But back home in the Caribbean, the men were heroes, with families huddled around radios and televisions whenever they played and shouts of jubilation erupting across entire communities whenever they won.

Today, the generation of players who won two World Cups, in 1975 and 1979, are acclaimed as living legends for stepping up to the crease regardless of the challenges ‚Äì and triumphing over teams from larger, more developed nations.

And as the region celebrates Emancipation Month to commemorate the end of slavery, they have been hailed as figures of regional pride whose mastery of a game imported by the British became a powerful symbol of political and cultural resistance.

Earlier this month, St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) hosted the first-ever Emancipation Cricket Festival, which the culture and tourism minister, Carlos James, described as a reminder of the powerful link ‚Äúbetween our emancipation, resistance, our Caribbean culture and the birth of Caribbean cricket‚Äù.

‚ÄúSome folks ask, why are you linking cricket ‚Äì which is a game of the English ‚Äì to emancipation. How does it correlate? Well, it was a period where every Caribbean national was glued to their radios ‚Ä¶ their television sets, to follow these men who went out in the middle of the cricket pitch,‚Äù James said.

By touring ‚Äì and winning ‚Äì that generation of sportsmen sent a powerful message, he said: ‚ÄúThey were making a political statement that we are young Black men from small Caribbean islands ‚Äì and we can dominate the world.‚Äù

James said that understanding the link between sport and politics ‚Äì and reviving the collective passion for the game ‚Äì could help turn the tide for today‚Äôs West Indies team, which has performed poorly in recent games.

St Vincent and the Grenadines‚Äô prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, one of the region‚Äôs strongest voices for reparations from Europe for the genocide of Native peoples and the enslavement of African people, said the aim of the emancipation festival was to bring awareness to the region‚Äôs period of struggle and resistance.

‚ÄúCricket, a game brought to us ‚Ä¶ by the British colonists, became our own existential instrument to aid our quest for national liberation, liberty, equality, fairness and justice,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe absorbed this English sport, mastered it, transcended its limits, made it our own, redefined it - and took it beyond the boundaries.‚Äù

He added that today, ‚Äúcricketing culture‚Äù remained vital to the region.

But such is the state of Caribbean cricket that Caricom, the 15-country regional bloc, recently said that it was ‚Äúdeeply concerned ‚Ä¶ about all aspects of the current state of the game in the region‚Äù.

In a statement, Caricom said: ‚ÄúCricket has, for decades, been a platform through which our small nations have collectively stood tall on the world stage. West Indies Cricket is very much a ‚Äòpublic good‚Äô.‚Äù

View image in fullscreen A West Indies legends cricket stamp. Photograph: Government of St Vincent and the Grenadines

It added that ‚Äúthe [West Indies] team‚Äôs recent performance is a moment of reckoning for this cherished Caribbean institution‚Äù.

Describing cricket as a ‚Äúglue that has kept us together‚Äù, Sir Clive Lloyd, who twice led the West Indies to world cup victory, welcomed the intervention by Caricom, saying: ‚ÄúWe are not a very rich area and [it will be good] if they can inject cash and whatever it is that is needed.‚Äù

Kesrick Williams, 35, a former cricketer from St Vincent, said some of today‚Äôs players were becoming disillusioned and needed more support. He called for a change in the general culture of West Indies cricket to revive passion for the sport among children and young people. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell when last I saw cricket being played in the road and the traffic had to stop. We have to build back that cricket culture and that firm love for the game,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúGrowing up, what would put a smile on my dad‚Äôs face was watching cricket. As a youngster when I saw that ‚Ä¶ I fell in love with cricket.‚Äù

James said Caricom was hoping to include the cricket heroes of the 70s ‚Äì who were recently the subject of a set of a commemorative stamps in SVG ‚Äì in discussions about the game:

‚ÄúMost of the legends are still around. And if we can take an ounce of passion that they have, and we move that from their generation to the next generation of Caribbean cricketers, it will make a whole heap of difference.‚Äù

üíª TECHNOLOGY HIGHLIGHTS
----------------------------------------

1. Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems - SiliconANGLE

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.
