1. [Finlight] Coca-Cola, Amazon, Google, And Nvidia Have Used This Startup's AI Avatars ‚Äî Inside Jeff Lu's $40M Rise To America's Fastest-Growing Company

In the same Palo Alto, California, building where Mark Zuckerberg grew Facebook in 2005, Jeff Lu now leads Akool, the generative AI platform that has created lifelike avatars for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company ranks No. 1 on this year's Inc. 5000 list, Inc. reports.
From Microsoft Intern to $40M AI Founder: How Jeff Lu Built One of America's Fastest-Growing Company
Lu, 35, began his career as a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) intern before earning a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois. Inc. says he later joined Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to work on Face ID technology for the iPhone, then moved to Google Cloud to focus on video processing services before leaving in 2020 due to what he described as restrictive policies on generative AI at the time.

Lu launched Akool as a side project, generating just over $100,000 in revenue in its second year and quickly building a 10-person team. Using eight graphics processing units, the startup trained specialized AI video "human models" in weeks, enabling the creation of digital avatars from photos, videos, or fully AI-generated characters, Inc. reports.
How a Coca-Cola League of Legends Campaign Catapulted Akool Into Global Marketing Fame
Akool's breakthrough came in early 2023 when it secured a project for Coca-Cola through a marketing agency that had benchmarked its technology against other tools on the market. Inc. says Coca-Cola selected Akool for a campaign promoting Coca-Cola Ultimate, a product collaboration with the video game League of Legends.
The campaign used Akool's AI face-swapping technology to let users place their faces onto the main character in a promotional video by uploading a selfie. It ran for six months in more than 80 countries and generated several million face swaps, Inc. reports.

Akool turned the project into a case study and used it in an email campaign targeting marketing agencies, which Inc. says helped the startup gain new business through word-of-mouth in the industry.
Streaming Avatars and AI Video Translation Push Akool's Revenue
In 2024, Inc. says Akool launched two high-demand features: a streaming avatar capable of real-time conversation and a video translation tool that converts videos into other languages while syncing mouth movements to the translated audio.
According to Inc., the video translation tool accounts for about 30% of company revenue, while streaming avatars generate roughly half of business-to-business sales.
The company partnered with Amazon Web Services, Google, and Nvidia to showcase these capabilities in technology demonstrations at their conferences and developed retail-focused avatars for companies in Asia to interact with shoppers, Inc. says.

Inside Akool's Live Video AI Technology That Rivals Google, OpenAI, and Adobe
By 2025, Inc. reports that Akool's revenue had reached $40 million, supported by a hybrid workforce of around 100 employees, two-thirds of whom are in engineering and a third on the business side, with about half working in the office.
The company's live video tools enable real-time speech translation during meetings and can replace a person's body with a responsive avatar that follows their movements. Lu told Inc. that Akool's live video expertise is ahead of competitors such as Google, OpenAI, and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), although the market remains highly competitive.¬†
With strong cash flow, Inc. says Akool plans to build larger AI models, including its own video foundation and voice-generation systems, with the goal of making avatar-generated videos indistinguishable from real life.

2. [Finlight] Could Bitcoin Really Hit $280,000 in 2025? This Legendary Trader Thinks So

Renowned trader Peter Brandt has backed a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) price prediction chart that suggests the cryptocurrency could reach a staggering $280,000 by the end of 2025.
What Happened: Brandt endorsed a Bitcoin cycle chart that aligns the¬†four major Bitcoin cycles since¬†2011. The chart predicts that Bitcoin could hit its peak¬†somewhere between September and December¬†2025.
The chart also hints at a price range of $150,000-$180,000 during a mid-channel run. However, if the pattern mirrors previous cycles and reaches the upper red line, the price could skyrocket to around $250,000-$280,000.
Brandt‚Äôs support of the chart adds weight to the prediction, considering his vast experience in market forecasting. 

The chart also displays a trend of diminishing returns with each cycle, implying that the rise may be less steep this time.
Also Read: Bitcoin Could Explode to $136,000 if This Happens, Says Analytics Firm
If Bitcoin continues to adhere to¬†these patterns, the next 12-15¬†months could witness¬†a new all-time high, even¬†if the percentage gain is¬†not as substantial as in previous years.
Why It Matters: The report also brings up the possibility of new factors¬†such as ETF flows, interest¬†rates, and global liquidity potentially modifying this timeline. 
These elements could introduce a level of unpredictability to the market, potentially disrupting the projected timeline and price points. 
As such, while the chart and Brandt‚Äôs endorsement provide a possible trajectory for Bitcoin, investors should be aware that the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs volatility could lead to different outcomes.

4. [Finlight] Israeli plan to displace 1m Palestinians spreads fear in Gaza

Palestinians were gripped by fear and anxiety on Sunday after the Israeli military said it was preparing for the forcible displacement of 1 million people from Gaza City.

The announcement came days after Israel said it intended to launch a new offensive to seize control of the enclave‚Äôs largest urban centre, in a plan that raised international alarm, and ahead of the IDF‚Äôs latest attacks in the Palestinian territory which Gaza‚Äôs health officials said had killed at least 40 people on Saturday including a baby in a tent and people seeking aid.

‚ÄúBased on the directives of the political leadership, and as part of the Israel Defense Forces‚Äô preparations to transfer civilians from combat zones to the southern Gaza Strip for their safety, starting tomorrow (Sunday), the provision of tents and shelter equipment for Gaza residents will resume,‚Äù read a statement by the Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT).

‚ÄúThe equipment will be transferred through the Kerem Shalom crossing by the United Nations and international relief organizations, after undergoing thorough inspection by the Land Crossings Authority of the Ministry of Defense,‚Äù it added.

Meanwhile, new recordings broadcast by an Israeli TV station showed the Israeli general who headed military intelligence on 7 October 2023 saying that 50 Palestinians ‚Äúmust die‚Äù for every person killed that day, and ‚Äúit does not matter now if they are children‚Äù. The channel said the undated conversations were recorded ‚Äúin recent months‚Äù.

And in the US the state department announced that it would stop issuing visas to children from Gaza in desperate need of medical care after an online pressure campaign from Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer close to Donald Trump who has described herself as ‚Äúa proud Islamophobe‚Äù.

Following Israel‚Äôs announcement, Palestinians in Gaza ‚Äì displaced repeatedly, forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their homes, stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies ‚Äì are bracing for another humanitarian disaster as a new offensive would force them toward the south of the territory and an uncertain future.

‚ÄúWe are already destroyed and exhausted, physically and psychologically, from repeated displacement, from the lack of food and water,‚Äù Akram Shlabia, 85, told the Guardian from the Shuja‚Äôiyya neighbourhood of Gaza City. ‚ÄúAnd now they want us to go to the south! Into nothingness, into the unknown, into a place without shelter or the basic means of life, even safety.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe will face many problems in displacement,‚Äù said Mazen Hasaneh, 40, from al-Tuffah neighbourhood, who has been displaced six times during the war. ‚ÄúFirst, securing a way to transport the necessary items like a tent and other basics, and of course many drivers will exploit people‚Äôs desperation and raise prices, while people have no money to pay.

‚ÄúThe second problem is finding a place to set up the tent and settle, along with the difficulty of finding and providing water and food. Everything about displacement is suffering, especially in our current conditions.‚Äù

Some families have already begun moving south to secure shelter in anticipation of possible evacuation, while others are contacting relatives to ask about available space should the relocation plan proceed. Yet many say they will remain in Gaza City, declaring they would rather stay than face the hardships of displacement.

‚ÄúIf the plan is carried out, I will look for a safe place for myself and my children within Gaza, and I will not consider moving to the south of the Strip,‚Äù said Asma Al-Barawi, 34, from al-Tuffah, the mother of seven children. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt leave the first time, and I won‚Äôt leave this time. The experiences and suffering I heard from the displaced who went south were harsh and unbearable.‚Äù

‚ÄúI lost everything because of this war,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI lost two of my brothers, two of my maternal aunts with their families, my cousin, and my father-in-law. And, I lost my new home, which I only left with some clothes.‚Äù

In recent days, heavy explosions have echoed from areas east of Gaza, where Israeli forces have intensified operations, including artillery barrages and the start of an incursion on the outskirts of the Sabra neighbourhood.

On Saturday a baby girl and her parents were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit a tent in al-Muwasi, previously designated a humanitarian zone by Israel, in southern Gaza, Nasser hospital officials and witnesses said.

‚ÄúTwo and a half months old, what has she done?‚Äù a neighbour, Fathi Shubeir, asked. ‚ÄúThey are civilians in an area designated safe.‚Äù

Israel‚Äôs military said it could not comment on the strike without more details.

Al-Muwasi is now one of the most heavily populated areas in Gaza after Israel pushed people into the desolate area. But the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last week that Israel planned to widen its coming military offensive to include the area, along with Gaza City and ‚Äúcentral camps‚Äù ‚Äì an apparent reference to the built-up Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza.

According to the civil defence agency, at least 13 of the Palestinians killed on Saturday were shot by troops as they were waiting to collect food aid near distribution sites in the north and the south.

There were also another 11 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza over the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Saturday, including at least one child. That brought malnutrition-related deaths due to the Israeli blockade on aid to 251.

Meanwhile in Israel police blasted crowds with water cannons and made dozens of arrests on Sunday as thousands of protesters in Jerusalem demanded a deal to free hostages in Gaza. The demonstrators aimed to shut down the country with a one-day strike that blocked roads and closed businesses.

Groups representing families of hostages organised the demonstrations as frustration grows in Israel over plans for the new military offensive, which many fear could further endanger the remaining hostages, about 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt win a war over the bodies of hostages,‚Äù protesters chanted in one of the largest and fiercest protests in 22 months of war.

Protesters gathered at dozens of places including outside politicians‚Äô homes, military headquarters and on major highways. They blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Police said they arrested 38 people.

Israel‚Äôs military offensive has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza‚Äôs health ministry, most of them civilians. The figure does not include the thousands believed to be buried under rubble or the thousands killed indirectly as a consequence of the war.


5. [Finlight] Mark Zuckerberg Once Admitted He Made An Early Mistake That Cost Him Billions, But Then Said It's Fine: Here's Why

The Meta Platforms, Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg once reflected on one of the most pivotal ‚Äî and costly ‚Äî missteps in Facebook's early history during a candid talk at Y Combinator's Startup School.
A Costly Lesson In The Early Days of Facebook
In a 2013 Y Combinator Startup School talk, Zuckerberg said that an early misstep in handling his partnership with fellow Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin probably cost him billions of dollars, but he learned from it and pushed forward.
Saverin, who served as Facebook's first CFO, was part of the founding team while the social network was still operating out of a Harvard dorm room.
‚ÄúI knew nothing when I got started,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúYou have to remember I was 19 years old when I started Facebook.‚Äù
He then spoke about his lack of experience in the early days and how it played a role in the conflict he had with Saverin.

Tensions Rose After Peter Thiel Introduced Vesting Schedule
The Meta CEO recalled that when investor Peter Thiel came in, he insisted all founders have vesting schedules (a way of earning equity over time so people can't just leave with their full share).
However, Zuckerberg didn't even know what that was.
"Part of the early conflict that I had with um with Eduardo, who‚Äôs one of our our founders ‚Ä¶ We hadn‚Äôt heard vesting schedules and then he [Saverin] just bounced, he never moved out to California with us," he stated.
Adding, "So Peter was like ‚Äòoh all you guys have to be on vesting schedules ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs fine, I mean it‚Äôs like that mistake probably cost me billions of dollars, but it‚Äôs fine ‚Ä¶ You just kind of keep pushing forward."

From Dorm Room Partners To Co-Founders To Legal Dispute
In 2005, tensions between Zuckerberg and Saverin escalated over business disagreements, reported Business Insider.
While Zuckerberg sought to secure venture capital funding and grow the platform, Saverin allegedly resisted dilution of his stake.¬†
Saverin famously sued Zuckerberg after his ownership stake in Facebook was significantly reduced ‚Äî a dispute later settled out of court and dramatized in the 2010 film "The Social Network."
Saverin retained the title of co-founder and reportedly walked away with a sizable fortune when Facebook went public in 2012.
Saverin Is A Billionaire Today And Have No Hard Feelings Toward Zuckerberg
He currently has a net worth of $42.1 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. In 2011, the billionaire gave up his U.S. citizenship.
In a 2012 interview with reporter F√°bio Altman, published that weekend by Veja, Saverin addressed the now-infamous email Zuckerberg sent to fellow Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz about potentially reducing Saverin's stake in the company.
He said, ‚ÄúI have only good things to say about Mark, there are no hard feelings between us.‚Äù

6. [Finlight] ‚ÄòNot off the table‚Äô: Marco Rubio leaves door open for Ukraine-Russia ceasefire; urges negotiations toward permanent peace

Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that a temporary ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia remains a possibility, despite stalled progress. Following President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Rubio emphasized that Russia's agreement is crucial for any ceasefire. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy stressed the urgency of a ceasefire to advance peace negotiations during discussions with European leaders.


7. [Finlight] Is Palantir the Next Tesla?

Key Points

Tesla is a popular stock among individual investors.

Palantir also doesn't have much institutional ownership.

Low institutional ownership can cause a stock to challenge traditional stock market practices.

10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ‚Ä∫

Palantir's (NASDAQ: PLTR) impressive rise over the past few years has been nothing short of incredible. Still, there have also been questions surrounding Palantir's ability to deliver on the high expectations baked into the stock price. There has been no shortage of analysts calling for Palantir's fall (myself included) due to extreme valuation.

This reminds me of another stock whose valuation metrics do not make a lot of sense: Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). However, Tesla has continued to defy traditional valuation metrics and has stayed at an elevated stock price for some time.

Could Palantir fall into this same realm? Or is it so inflated that a crash is coming?

Image source: Getty Images.

Tesla and Palantir's rise look similar

Tesla stock's primary rise started in 2020, increasing from about $24 per share all the way to around today's $340 per share. It returned over 1,100% over that time frame, resulting in a rise that few stocks have ever matched.

Palantir's rise has similarly been rapid and impressive. Its stock rose from around $16 to $185 at the time of this writing, resulting in about 1,000% gains. Both companies delivered impressive performance in a very short amount of time, despite not increasing their revenue by 10 times (or more) over that time frame.

As a result, most investors assume that they've grown too fast and are ripe for a pullback. But this analysis excludes a significant aspect of the investment thesis.

Palantir and Tesla have low institutional ownership

One of the reasons why Tesla's stock did so well over that time frame is that individual investors owned it. Individual investors don't have the same mindset as institutions. Various funds and other money managers are likely more devoted to traditional valuation metrics. If their discounted cash flow (DCF) models don't work out, then they avoid the stock entirely.

However, companies like Tesla and Palantir break the mold of what traditional finance teaches, which can invalidate the assumptions that go into these models.

Individual investors are far more likely to take a long-term view and note that Tesla's technology and vision could allow it to deliver massive growth over the long term. This illustrates a huge difference in approaches: Institutional investors utilize trailing metrics to predict the future, while individual investors look at the world and see where it could go.


8. [Finlight] The Most Important Thing for Advance Auto Parts Investors to Watch in 2025

Key Points

Advanced Auto Part's restructuring has returned the company to profitability, and it should start generating cash in the second half.

The stock was recently sold off due to higher interest rate payments impacting profitability.

Investors should look for progress in the company's efforts to improve its inventory in stores and how quickly it sells it compared to paying its suppliers.

10 stocks we like better than Advance Auto Parts ‚Ä∫

It's fair to say the latest earnings report from Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP) was not well received by the market -- the stock was initially sold off by a mid-teens percentage. However, I think there was more good than bad in the actual numbers. That's not to say anyone should get overly excited, because this is still an underperforming company. Still, there are some positives here, and there are some things for the stock's bulls to build on.

The investment case for Advance Auto Parts

The case for buying the stock is well known, and if not, it should be, because the company has been around for over a decade. Simply put, the auto parts retailer's operational metrics are so woefully short of its peers, principally AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive, that all it will take is some restructuring to get the company somewhere close to its peers' margins, cash flow, and earnings, and a substantial amount of value will be generated for investors.

That was the gist of the case when activist investor Starboard Value got involved a decade ago (only to exit in 2021), having failed mainly in helping engineer any kind of significant closing of the gap with AutoZone and O'Reilly.

In case you are wondering what I'm referring to, here are a few charts to demonstrate. They show earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins, free cash flow (FCF) generated from assets, and finally return on invested capital (ROIC).

None of these metrics has improved over the last decade.

The problem with Advance Auto Parts

The main areas of improvement that Starboard articulated a decade ago still apply today. Auto parts retailing is a business that ensures the right stock is in the right store at the right time. In other words, it's a game of optimizing inventory, building supplier relationships, and above all, logistics management. Time is of the essence in the industry, as customers, whether in the do-it-yourself or especially in the do-it-for-me market, usually demand a part as soon as possible to help repair a vehicle and get it back roadworthy.


9. [Finlight] Girl, 11, dies after incident at river in Cornwall

An 11-year-old girl has died after an incident in the water at a beauty spot in Cornwall.

Emergency services were called to Wacker Quay on the Lynher River near Torpoint at about 6pm on Saturday after being alerted about a person in the water, police said.

Officers said the girl, from South Devon, was recovered and given emergency treatment but was confirmed dead at the scene.

A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said: ‚ÄúHer next of kin have been informed and will be supported by specialist officers.

‚ÄúThe death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner.‚Äù

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains one of the world's most influential and closely tracked tech stocks. Its massive installed base, iconic products, and fast-growing Services business make it a focal point for both growth and value investors. As of August 2025, Apple's share price is hovering near all-time highs as investors weigh the company's future earnings power in artificial intelligence (AI), wearables, and digital services.

Below, we'll take a close look at how Apple stock is performing today, where its valuation stands, and what experts think could happen to its price in 2025, 2026, and 2030. You'll find projections from Wall Street analysts and independent models, along with an overview of the key trends, possible risks, and different opinions shaping Apple's future.

Current Apple Stock Overview

Market Cap: $3.25 trillion

Trailing P/E Ratio: 32.36

Forward P/E Ratio: 26.95

1-Year Return: +1.86%

2025 Year to Date: Down roughly 15%, but rebounding strongly from earlier lows

As of August 2025, Apple (AAPL) trades near $224 per share, recovering from a steep first-half drop of over 15% as investor sentiment improves. The stock's trailing P/E ratio of 32.36 sits well above its long-term average in the low-to-mid 20s, reflecting the market's continued premium on Apple's brand and earnings power. Over the past year, shares have inched up about 1.9%, showcasing the company's historical resilience and ability to rebound from downturns. This elevated valuation suggests investors expect steady profit growth despite competitive pressures and rapid tech sector changes.

With high margins and recurring revenue, Apple's Services division (App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and more) is now the company's growth engine. iPhone demand, especially in China and India, remains a central driver, with an anticipated surge for the iPhone 17 launch in the third quarter of 2025. AI has been called an ‚Äúelephant in the room.‚Äù Apple's monetization strategy there has yet to emerge, with Wall Street still waiting for significant generative AI products. Competitive and regulatory headwinds are increasing, but Apple's pricing power and sticky ecosystem underpin optimism for the long-term.


11. [Finlight] Brooklyn lounge shooting leaves 3 dead, 8 hurt; police seek multiple suspects

Three people were killed and eight others wounded in a shooting at a crowded nightclub in Brooklyn early Sunday (August 17) morning, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

Officers responded to multiple emergency calls at about 3.27am reporting gunfire inside Taste of the City Lounge at 903 Franklin Avenue, in the Crown Heights neighborhood, Tisch told reporters at the scene.

"Officers arrived within minutes of the first 911 calls and found numerous gunshot victims inside the location. Currently we have identified 11 victims ranging in age from 27 to 61, eight males and three females," Tisch said.

Three men ‚Äì aged 27, 35, and one of unknown age ‚Äì were pronounced dead at the scene. The other eight victims were transported to local hospitals with injuries described as non-life-threatening. Names of the victims are being withheld pending family notification.

Tisch said preliminary investigation indicated a dispute inside the packed club led to the shooting, involving multiple shooters.

At least 36 shell casings from multiple firearms were recovered, and police also found a gun near Bedford Avenue and Eastern Parkway.

Detectives are reviewing CCTV footage and searching for suspects, but no arrests have been made.

"Eleven people shot, three dead. It‚Äôs a terrible shooting that occurred in the city of New York," Tisch said.

The commissioner noted that shootings in New York City have reached record lows this year, calling Sunday‚Äôs incident "an anomaly" and promising a thorough investigation.

Tisch said there had been a non-fatal shooting at the same location in November 2024, but could not confirm whether metal detectors or other security measures were in place at the club.

Police cordoned off the area with tape and continued to collect evidence at the scene later Sunday morning.


12. [Finlight] 2 Great Dividend Stocks for the Long Haul You'll Likely Wish You Bought 10 Years From Now

Tractor Supply's business has been resilient, benefiting from steady demand in rural and suburban markets. Its focus on rural lifestyle products, store expansion, and customer loyalty programs has provided a reliable growth engine.

Another key factor making Tractor Supply look attractive is its loyalty program, Neighbor's Club. The program now has 41 million members. Highlighting its importance, 80% of its sales come from members. This program drives repeat visits and helps the company better target promotions. It's a quiet advantage that supports the company's growth story and ultimately its dividend growth prospects.

In addition, a low payout ratio like this enables the rural retailer to maintain these practices while continuing to raise its dividend over time. Indeed, with 16 consecutive years of dividend increases, Tractor Supply has demonstrated a commitment to rewarding shareholders with a growing stream of cash in a disciplined fashion.

Based on its stock price today, Tractor Supply offers investors a dividend yield of about 1.5%, paying $0.92 annually (the quarterly payment currently stands at $0.23). Importantly, the company has a payout ratio of just 44%, leaving plenty of room for the company to pay shareholders quarterly while reinvesting in its operations and repurchasing shares.

Let's take a look at how each company's dividend stacks up today, consider the underlying business trends that support (or challenge) those payouts, and explore what income-focused investors should keep in mind before committing capital for the long haul. Choosing whether to invest in either of these companies isn't just about their dividend yield today. It's more complex than that. So, let's dig into what makes each of these dividend stocks unique and attractive in their own right.

Tractor Supply (NASDAQ: TSCO) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) have both established themselves as dependable dividend payers. Yet, their strengths, risks, and income profiles could not be more different. Tractor Supply, the leading rural retailer, has a smaller yield but comes with a track record of measured growth and strong coverage. Coffee giant Starbucks offers a richer payout but faces questions about its sustainability.

Story Continues

Starbucks: higher yield but more risk

Starbucks pays a dividend yield of roughly 2.6% as of this writing. Its quarterly payments total $2.44 annually. While the payout is more generous than Tractor Supply's, there's more risk to it. This is evidenced by the fact that the company's payout ratio currently exceeds 100% of earnings. That means the coffee giant is currently paying more in dividends than it earns, raising questions about the dividend's long-term sustainability at this level unless profits improve.

At the moment, the business doesn't look great on the surface. In its most recent quarter, Starbucks reported generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share of $0.49, compared with a quarterly dividend of $0.61. Management has also notably opted not to provide full-year 2025 guidance as it works through plans to revitalize its business. So, for now, we just have to hope the company's slow revenue growth (sales increased just 2% year over year in the company's most recent quarter) will pick back up soon.

Despite rough fundamentals at the moment, management is confident about the company's future. It believes its current negative sales trends are only temporary. Under new leadership, Starbucks is working to simplify its menu, speed up service, and modernize operations. If these efforts are successful and uncertainty is replaced by excitement, the stock price could benefit and the dividend will likely get robust support from growing earnings.

For now, however, the higher yield comes with greater uncertainty. But that doesn't mean investors should rule Starbucks out. The higher yield helps make up for some of the uncertainty. Additionally, the stock price could jump if the company starts demonstrating a successful turnaround.

The verdict on both of these dividend stocks? They make a dynamic pair when bought together. For investors seeking a reliable, lower-risk income stream backed by a durable business model, Tractor Supply is a great dividend investment idea. Its modest dividend yield is backed by a durable business, a long history, and excellent financials. Starbucks, on the other hand, offers a higher yield and the potential for a jump in the stock price if management's efforts to revitalize the business are successful.

13. [Finlight] 'It Might've Been A Spirit, But It Wasn't The Holy One,' Says Dave Ramsey As Couple Waits On God To Sell $60,000 In Crypto

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

Arabella from Springfield, Missouri, told "The Ramsey Show" in April that she faced $60,000 in cryptocurrency, $14,000 in student loans and $37,000 in auto debt while preparing to close on her first home.

The question she posed to financial coach Dave Ramsey was whether they should sell their crypto to pay off debt or wait for what they believed might be divine timing.

Couple Questions Whether To Cash Out

Arabella explained that their crypto portfolio once held an additional $30,000 in value, but it dropped after policy announcements from President Donald Trump. She and her husband wondered if holding the coins longer could restore their lost wealth.

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market ‚Äî and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses ‚Äî no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

"I wouldn't try to time the market with it," said co-host Jade Warshaw. "You guys are in debt today, and you're closing on the house really quickly. So, I would liquidate this crypto, and I would pay off this debt. I would do that instantly."

Ramsey calls digital assets "one of the most volatile, high-risk investments on the planet." He warned that they're "not technically an investment ‚Äî it's actually called speculation."

Rolling The Dice On Crypto

Arabella pushed back, saying their holdings were not meme coins, but Ramsey dismissed the difference. He cautioned that external events, such as tariffs or policy remarks, could sink their portfolio overnight.

"And so what happens when Trump burps again? You're screwed," Ramsey said. "It's the roll of the dice. You're in Vegas, and your car payment is on the line."

He then reframed her thinking with a simple question: If she had no debt today, would she borrow against her car or take out credit cards to buy $60,000 worth of crypto? "Absolutely not," Arabella replied,

"It's the same thing," Ramsey said. "If you don't sell it today, you'll borrow it again tomorrow."

Spiritual Beliefs Collide With Financial Advice

"We are Christian and we do not gamble," Arabella said, revealing another layer of her decision-making. "But we felt like God showed us these three specific coins that we're invested in. And we have just been waiting for the right time for him to show us when to sell, which is why we've been holding for five years through two bull runs."


14. [Finlight] Not All Advisors Are Equal ‚Äî Here's the Real Difference Between Fiduciary and Financial Advisors

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.

If you've ever thought about hiring someone to help manage your money, you've probably run into a tangle of titles: financial advisor, financial planner, wealth strategist, investment manager, fiduciary advisor, and more. On the surface, they can all sound the same ‚Äî and many people use "financial advisor" as a catch-all for anyone who works with investments or retirement planning. But in reality, there's a critical distinction hiding behind those labels, and it can have a huge impact on your financial future. That difference comes down to whether or not your advisor is a fiduciary.

Understanding what separates a fiduciary advisor from a traditional financial advisor isn't just a matter of jargon ‚Äî it's about knowing whether the person giving you advice is legally required to put your best interests ahead of their own. For many investors, that one detail is the difference between a plan built around your goals and one that quietly funnels money into products that benefit the advisor more than you.

What Is a Financial Advisor?

At its broadest, the term "financial advisor" can apply to almost anyone in the business of helping clients manage their money. This could mean someone who sells you life insurance, someone who opens a retirement account, or someone who builds a long-term investment plan. Financial advisors can be found at the biggest brokerage firms, at banks, or operating independently.

The key thing to understand is that not all financial advisors operate under the same legal standard of care. Many advisors are held only to what's called the suitability standard. That means they're obligated to recommend products that are "suitable" for your circumstances, but not necessarily the best or most cost-effective options available. In practice, that could look like an advisor steering you into a mutual fund with higher fees that pays them a commission, even though there's a nearly identical fund available with much lower costs. Both options may be "suitable," but only one puts more money in your pocket over time. The other keeps more money in theirs.

This doesn't mean all financial advisors are acting against your interests ‚Äî many genuinely want to help ‚Äî but it does highlight why the lack of a stronger legal requirement can leave room for conflicts of interest. And that's where fiduciary advisors come in.

What Is a Fiduciary Advisor?

A fiduciary advisor is different because they're bound to a much stricter standard ‚Äî the fiduciary standard. This means they are legally and ethically required to put your best interests first at all times. Fiduciaries must minimize conflicts of interest whenever possible, disclose any conflicts that remain, and always ensure that the advice they give benefits you, not them.


15. [Finlight] Here's How This Forgotten Healthcare Stock Could Generate Life-Changing Returns

Key Points

CRISPR Therapeutics' first approved therapy, Casgevy, was a breakthrough.

One of Casgevy's biggest achievements may be demonstrating the viability of CRISPR Therapeutics' strategy.

The biotech company could soar if it can follow up that win with more clinical and regulatory milestones.

10 stocks we like better than CRISPR Therapeutics ‚Ä∫

Over the past few years, the market hasn't been kind to somewhat speculative, unprofitable stocks. CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), a mid-cap biotech, fits that description. The company's shares are down by 24% since mid-2022. The S&P 500 is up 50% over the same period.

Despite this terrible performance, there are reasons to believe that CRISPR Therapeutics could still generate life-changing returns for investors willing to be patient. Here's how the biotech could pull it off.

CRISPR Therapeutics' first success

CRISPR Therapeutics' first approval was for Casgevy, a treatment for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT), which it developed in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Before Casgevy, no CRISPR-based gene-editing medicine had been approved.

While it became the first, it still faces some challenges. Ex vivo gene-editing therapies require a complex manufacturing and administration process that can only be performed in authorized treatment centers (ATCs). Moreover, they're expensive. Casgevy costs $2.2 million in the U.S. Getting third-party payers on board for that is no easy feat.

Image source: Getty Images.

Still, CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are making steady progress. As of the second quarter, CRISPR Therapeutics had achieved its goal of activating 75 ATCs. It had also secured reimbursement for eligible patients in 10 countries. The two companies estimate there are roughly 60,000 eligible SCD and TDT patients in the regions they have targeted.

Let's say they continue to strike reimbursement deals and can count on third-party coverage for 70% of this target population (42,000 people), then go on to treat another 30% of that group in the next decade (12,600 patients). Assuming they could extend that $2.2 million price tag to those countries, Casgevy could generate more than $27.7 billion over this period. Based on its agreement with Vertex, 40% would go to CRISPR Therapeutics, or roughly $11.1 billion over a decade. That's not bad, but it's not that impressive either.

So, while Casgevy could contribute meaningfully to CRISPR Therapeutics' results -- and may even reach blockbuster status at some point -- the medicine may primarily serve as a proof of concept to demonstrate that the biotech's approach can be effective.


16. [Finlight] Snap Stock Plunged After Earnings. Buy the Dip?

Key Points

Sponsored Snaps are showing strong engagement and conversion gains.

Subscription revenue from Snapchat+ is growing quickly from a small base.

Heavy stock-based compensation and dilution keep valuation concerns high.

10 stocks we like better than Snap ‚Ä∫

Snap (NYSE: SNAP), the parent company of social media platform Snapchat, took a hard hit following its second‚Äëquarter earnings release earlier this month. Shares tumbled, driven by worries about slowing growth, execution missteps, and a worsening net loss. But dig deeper, and the underlying narrative is more nuanced; there were a lot of positives in the report, too.

Revenue and users continue to grow at a robust rate, free cash flow has turned positive year over year, and new ad formats, such as sponsored Snaps, are demonstrating real engagement traction. Given the mix of good and bad in its underlying business and the stock's recent sell-off, it makes sense to check whether the shares have been pushed into oversold territory.

Let's look at what changed in the business and what it might mean for investors today.

Image source: Getty Images.

Momentum in key areas

Snap reported second-quarter revenue of $1.345 billion, marking a 9% gain from a year earlier. Further, the lifeblood of the company -- user activity -- performed exceptionally well.

Daily active users (DAUs) rose 9% to 469 million, while monthly active users (MAUs) climbed 7% to 932 million. Operating cash flow reached $88 million, and free cash flow came in positive at $24 million, a notable reversal from the previous year, when the company burned cash. Still, Snap posted a net loss of $263 million (wider than a net loss of $249 million in the year-ago quarter), and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) slid lower on a year-over-year basis to $41 million, underscoring that profitability remains out of reach.



An ad platform glitch -- where auction settings pushed some campaigns to clear at unusually low prices -- weighed on performance early in the quarter. Snap reversed the change mid-period, and management said that advertiser activity is recovering.



One of my favorite data points to support the bull case: On the diversification front, "other revenue" -- primarily from subscriptions like Snapchat+ -- grew 64% year over year, and Snapchat+ subscribers rose roughly 42%, nearing 16 million.

One of the quarter's most promising developments was sponsored Snaps -- video ads delivered directly into users' inboxes. Snap co-founder Evan Spiegel said in the company's second-quarter earnings call that after a user opens a sponsored Snap from their chat feed, they "exhibit significantly higher engagement per full-screen ad view, driving a 2x increase in conversion, a 5x increase in click-to-convert ratios and a 2x increase in website dwell times compared to other inventories. That signals a powerful new lever for monetizing deeply engaged users.



Given the company's fast-growing subscription business, advertising revenue growth trends after the glitch was addressed, and momentum in sponsored Snaps, management guided for continued top-line growth in Q3.


17. [Finlight] Warren Buffett Doubles Down On America's Housing Boom, Upping Berkshire's Holdings In Homebuilders And Building Supply Firms By Triple Digits

Warren Buffett‚Äòs Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) has made a significant pivot towards the U.S. housing market, according to its second-quarter 13F filing for 2025, which was filed on Aug. 14, 2025.
The legendary investor established several new positions in home construction and building supply companies while dramatically increasing his stake in another, signaling a strong conviction in the sector.
Summary Of Berkshire‚Äôs Key Housing-Related Moves In Q2

Buffett Bets On Homebuilders
The most notable move was a 136% increase in Berkshire‚Äôs holding of Pool Corp. (NASDAQ:POOL), a distributor of swimming pool supplies. 
The position grew from 1,464,000 shares in the first quarter to 3,458,885 shares by the end of the second quarter on June 30, 2025.
Berkshire Hathaway initiated major new stakes in two of the largest U.S. homebuilders:
DR Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI): A new position of 1,485,350 shares was acquired, valued at $191.49 million.
Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN): Berkshire added a new stake of 7,048,993 Class A shares worth $779.69 million. This is in addition to boosting its existing stake in Lennar Corp.‚Äôs Class B (NYSE:LEN) shares by 19%, from 152,572 to 180,930 shares. The total value of Berkshire‚Äôs Lennar holdings is now approximately $799 million.

Expanding Into Building Materials And Supplies
Beyond homebuilders, the filing revealed new investments in companies that supply the construction industry:
Nucor Corp. (NYSE:NUE): A new position of 6,614,112 shares in the steel producer, valued at $856.79 million.
Allegion PLC (NYSE:ALLE): A new stake of 780,133 shares, valued at $112.43 million.

18. [Finlight] Stablecoin Boom Has Made Crypto Ramps 'Sexier' M&A Targets, Says VanEck VC

Companies that serve as connective tissue between digital assets and legacy payments systems are getting a glow-up from stablecoins this year, according to VanEck Ventures Managing Partner Juan Lopez.

As companies continue to explore new use cases with dollar-pegged tokens, those that help customers swap between cash and crypto are becoming some of the hottest targets for mergers and acquisitions, he told Decrypt in a recent interview.

Although they were mostly perceived as a way to let customers easily purchase crypto in the past, Lopez said that on-and-off ramps are increasingly being viewed as valuable touch points for facilitating everyday transactions through stablecoins.

‚ÄúOn-and-off ramp companies initially were the ones that were connecting the legacy payment systems with the sort of blockchain-adjacent systems that exchanges pioneered,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow they can go from simply calling themselves on-and-off ramps to full-fledged payments providers built on this really novel infrastructure, which is a lot sexier.‚Äù

With last month‚Äôs passage of stablecoin legislation in the U.S., experts anticipate an explosion of stablecoins under the GENIUS Act. With a federal framework in place, Citigroup said this week that it‚Äôs exploring a stablecoin, months after Bank of America signaled the same.

Lopez said that stablecoins emerged within the crypto industry primarily as a way for exchanges to overcome long settlement times that customers faced when funding accounts, but experimentation has pushed their utility far beyond that.

‚ÄúOn-and-off ramps have been a large driver for some of the new use cases that we hear around stablecoins,‚Äù he said, pointing to cross-border remittances and business-to-business payments.

Earlier this year, crypto payments service MoonPay acquired Helio and Unstoppable Finance, "underscoring the vision for crypto payments,‚Äù according to a report from Architect Partners.

The move followed payment giant Stripe‚Äôs acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge last year, one of the largest deals in the industry‚Äôs history valued at $1.1 billion.

Ripple said earlier this month that it would purchase Rail, a Toronto-based payments platform, for $200 million. Ripple highlighted the firm‚Äôs ability to offer ‚Äúcomprehensive stablecoin pay-ins and pay-outs‚Äù without requiring a company to hold crypto on its balance sheet.

Fed Ends Supervisory Program Overseeing Banks' Crypto Activity

Lopez noted that the licenses on-and-off ramp companies own could be a factor as well, letting companies expand into new businesses or jurisdictions than they could otherwise.

‚ÄúIt's really a time-to-market value,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there's a particular player that wants to enter a particular business, they can do so much faster they can acquire a business that's gone through all the regulatory hurdles to actually be licensed to operate.‚Äù


19. [Finlight] Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple and Bank of America Stock and Piling Into an Embattled Healthcare Stock Down 46% This Year

Apple has been dealing with tariff-related issues all year. Buffett and Berkshire may have foreseen this once President Donald Trump won the election, leading them to pare back their position. If Berkshire is concerned about the economy, perhaps paring back some of their bank holdings makes sense as well, as banks are typically cyclical.

There's also talk that Berkshire is staying conservative to prepare for the big transition that will see Buffett step down as CEO but retain his role as chairman of the board of directors. Longtime Berkshire veteran Greg Abel is set to step into Buffett's big shoes. Berkshire's stock got off to a terrific start this year but has floundered since the transition was announced.

While the bull market has raged for more than 2.5 years, Berkshire has plodded along conservatively, hoarding hundreds of billions of dollars in cash and cash equivalents, selling more stocks than it buys, and even turning away from share repurchases more recently. Given stretched valuations and the stock market's big run, many investors simply think Buffett and his team are not seeing compelling opportunities.

In the second quarter, Berkshire continued to trim its largest position, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and its third-largest holding, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). In the quarter, Berkshire sold 7% of its stake in Apple and 4% of its stake in Bank of America. Over the past year, Berkshire has reduced its stake in Apple by 30% and Bank of America by 41%.

While Berkshire has been quiet in recent quarters, the large conglomerate made some notable moves in the second quarter. Berkshire recently sold some shares in two of its largest positions, while piling into an embattled healthcare stock that has struggled immensely this year.

Each quarter, investors anxiously await Warren Buffett's company B erkshire Hathaway filing its 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, divulging what stocks Berkshire held at the end of the quarter, and, therefore, what stocks the company bought and sold in any given quarter. Investors are always looking for a glimpse into the genius of Buffett and his team of investors, especially with Buffett set to step down as CEO of the company at the end of the year.

Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's team of investors continued a recent trend in trimming down their positions in Apple and Bank of America.

Story Continues

Playing contrarian on this healthcare giant

In the second quarter, Berkshire initiated a $1.57 billion position in the nation's largest healthcare insurer, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH). UnitedHealth's stock has been crushed this year and is down about 46%. However, after the news came out about Berkshire buying the stock, shares increased close to 9.5% in after-hours trading.

UnitedHealth has dealt with a flurry of issues this year, including higher medical insurance costs, which is a common trend across the sector. In the second quarter, management at UnitedHealth revised its prior full-year outlook down to $16 adjusted earnings per share, significantly below Wall Street's consensus estimates coming into the year.

The main culprit is medical costs, which management thinks will come in $6.5 billion higher than previously expected. The sector has struggled in the face of an aging population, higher utilization of and more expensive services, higher drug prices, and inflation.

Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing UnitedHealth in a criminal investigation over the way it charges customers in its Medicare Advantage program. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported on suspicious billing practices that allegedly increase payouts to the company. In a statement in late July, UnitedHealth said it is cooperating with the DOJ but has "full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process."

At their core, Buffett and his team are value investors, meaning they look for stocks with a market value below a company's perceived intrinsic value. While UnitedHealth has struggled and is forecasting a significant earnings decline this year, management is still projecting double-digit revenue growth in 2025. Furthermore, the company's balance sheet seems to be on solid footing. Sure, the company has high debt, but through the first six months of the year, earnings from operations of about $14.3 billion are still more than 7 times debt interest expense.

Additionally, UnitedHealth's dividend yield is now roughly 3.25%, while the company's trailing free-cash-flow yield is above 10%, showing the company can easily cover the dividend for the foreseeable future. In fact, UnitedHealth recently increased its quarterly dividend by 5%.

Ultimately, UnitedHealth trades at a lower-than-usual forward price-to-earnings ratio, despite expectations of much lower earnings this year, and at less than 1 times revenue. Buffett and his team value strong moats, so with UnitedHealth still controlling market share in the healthcare insurance industry, they likely see an attractive risk-reward proposition.

20. [Finlight] Jack Dorsey Advocates for Bitcoin Use as Everyday Currency 'As It Was Designed to Be'

Block CEO Jack Dorsey¬†has once again emphasized his stance on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), advocating for its use as everyday money, a vision originally proposed by Bitcoin‚Äôs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.
What Happened: Dorsey stressed that Bitcoin‚Äôs ultimate purpose should be for daily transactions, not merely¬†speculative trading. 
‚ÄúWe want Bitcoin¬†to become p2p electronic cash¬†and everyday money, as it¬†was designed to be,‚Äù Dorsey¬†stated in a post on X.

Dorsey‚Äôs comments were in response to a post by Entropy Capital regarding how Block has developed a comprehensive Bitcoin ecosystem. This system comprises Square, a platform that¬†allows merchants to accept Bitcoin¬†payments, and Cash App, a wallet designed for quick and inexpensive transactions. 
Other elements include¬†Bitkey, a self-custody hardware wallet¬†for offline Bitcoin storage, and Proto, a Bitcoin mining infrastructure.
Also Read: Jack Dorsey Says Bluesky‚Äôs Rapid Expansion Fueled by X Exodus: ‚ÄòNot a Great Way To Build a Product‚Äô
Dorsey‚Äôs message is unequivocal: Bitcoin is destined to become a¬†part of everyday transactions, and¬†Block is strategically positioning itself to facilitate this transition.
Simultaneously, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent¬†has indicated that the U.S.¬†is dedicated to exploring ways to accumulate more Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $118,473.47, a slight dip from its intraday peak of $119,399.29.
Why It Matters: Dorsey‚Äôs renewed emphasis on Bitcoin‚Äôs intended use as everyday money underscores the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream financial landscape. 
With Block‚Äôs comprehensive Bitcoin ecosystem, the company is well-positioned to lead the charge in this transition, potentially influencing other companies to follow suit. 
Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs interest in accumulating Bitcoin signals a shift in governmental attitudes towards cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for more widespread adoption and regulatory clarity.
