Good morning, August fourteenth. Cisco's strong outlook fuels tech optimism. Google faces Chrome breakup pressure. Block's debt offering signals growth. Morgan Stanley warns of hidden market risks. Watch ticker X-Y-Z and Robinhood, ticker H-O-O-D, today.


Looking at today's economic calendar, the spotlight is firmly on Australian employment data. At one thirty A-M Eastern, we receive both the Employment Change and Unemployment Rate figures for July.

The Employment Change is projected to show an increase of twenty-five thousand jobs, a significant jump from the prior reading of just two thousand. This positive surprise could bolster the Australian dollar. Conversely, a weaker number could pressure it downward.

Simultaneously, the Unemployment Rate is expected to decrease slightly to four point two percent from four point three percent. This would signal a tightening labor market, potentially fueling inflation concerns and influencing the Reserve Bank of Australia’s future policy decisions.

Traders should also monitor the Full Time Employment Change data, released at the same time, for a more granular understanding of the labor market's health. Expect heightened volatility in Australian dollar crosses around the one thirty A-M Eastern release.

Later, at six A-M Eastern, Germany releases Wholesale Prices data, both month-over-month and year-over-year. While classified as medium-impact, these figures offer insights into inflationary pressures within the German economy and could influence sentiment towards the Euro. Keep an eye on these numbers as they provide context to Europe’s overall economic health, especially for the European Central Bank.


Good morning, premium subscribers. Let's dive into pre-market activity. Futures are indicating a cautiously optimistic open. S-and-P futures are up slightly, reflecting overnight gains in Asia. Nasdaq futures are mirroring that sentiment, while Dow futures show modest gains, buoyed by yesterday's positive earnings reports. Overseas markets are influencing futures with positive economic data coming from Europe.

Notable pre-market movers include Miami International Holdings, ticker M-I-A-X, which priced its I-P-O at twenty-three dollars per share, exceeding expectations. Look for volatility at the open. Pre-market volume is moderate, suggesting a measured start to trading. The implied open suggests a continuation of yesterday's trends, but be prepared for potential shifts as the day progresses.

Keep an eye on early trading volume as it could signal the direction of the market for today's session. News regarding interest rate outlooks will be impactful today. Consider these factors as you navigate today's trading. Good luck.


Yesterday's session saw markets close mixed, with the S-and-P five hundred holding steady near all-time highs despite weakness in the ticker D-O-W --. Overnight, news flow has been relatively light, though comments from several Federal Reserve officials suggest a continued commitment to data dependency regarding future rate decisions. Asian markets closed moderately higher, led by gains in Japan, though Chinese equities remain under pressure amid ongoing economic concerns.

European markets are currently trading mixed, with the ticker F-T-S-E -- in London slightly lower and the ticker D-A-X -- in Frankfurt holding marginal gains. Overnight, key levels broken include resistance at four thousand five hundred on the Nikkei, suggesting potential further upside for Japanese equities.

Looking ahead to today, traders should monitor the ten-year Treasury yield, currently trading around four point two percent, for further clues on interest rate sentiment. Focus will also be on the eight thirty A-M E-T first time unemployment claims data for insights into the labor market. Watch ticker Q-Q-Q for direction after yesterday's sideways action. Support lies at four hundred sixty and resistance at four hundred sixty-five. A break of either level will likely dictate intraday direction.

Before the bell, we anticipate reports from names like Verizon, ticker V-Z, and General Electric, ticker G-E. Key metrics to watch for Verizon include subscriber growth and average revenue per user. Analysts are projecting around thirty-three cents earnings per share. For General Electric, focus on their aviation segment performance and progress on debt reduction; estimates suggest seventy cents earnings per share.

After the close, Microsoft, ticker M-S-F-T, takes center stage. Cloud revenue growth and guidance for the upcoming quarter will be critical. The street expects two point five dollars earnings per share. Additionally, Visa, ticker V, will report. Transaction volumes and cross-border payments are key to gauging their performance. Analysts expect about two dollars and twenty cents earnings per share.

Positive surprises could boost respective stock prices, while misses may trigger pullbacks. Be prepared for volatility, particularly after the Microsoft report. Keep a close watch on pre-market and after-hours trading to gauge initial reactions. These earnings releases will likely impact broader market sentiment throughout the day.


Good morning, premium subscribers. Today, we're watching the energy and financial sectors closely. Energy is showing pre-market strength, buoyed by rising crude oil prices, currently trading above eighty dollars a barrel, and geopolitical tensions. Expect continued upward momentum, potentially benefiting from a weaker dollar. Key catalysts include the weekly inventory report due out at ten thirty A-M, and any further escalation in the Middle East. Leading stocks to watch are E-X-X-O-N, Chevron, ticker C-V-X, and Schlumberger, ticker S-L-B. Look for potential profit-taking later in the session.

Conversely, the financial sector is exhibiting pre-market weakness, driven by yesterday’s disappointing earnings from J-P Morgan Chase, and concerns regarding interest rate policy. We are seeing some hints of rotation out of financials into defensive sectors, particularly consumer staples. Watch for further developments on the regional bank front, as that could trigger more pronounced selling. Key names to track today are Bank of America, ticker B-A-C, and Wells Fargo, ticker W-F-C. Any positive economic data released around eight thirty A-M could provide a much-needed boost, but be prepared for continued volatility in this sector.

Earnings season continues. Watch for reports from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley before the bell. Analysts will be particularly interested in their guidance for investment banking revenue and trading activity. Key metrics to watch include net interest margin, loan growth, and capital ratios.

In precious metals, watch gold's performance during Asian and European trading hours. We anticipate early movements will set the tone for U-S trading. Consider position adjustments based on early price action.

Dollar strength remains a key factor. A stronger dollar typically weighs on commodity prices, including copper and agricultural futures. Factor this inverse relationship into your trading decisions.

Currency moves are significantly impacting U.S. pre-market trading. A strengthening dollar, especially against the Yen, could weigh on U.S. exporters. Watch for further volatility as the day progresses. Keep an eye on the ten-year Treasury yield which sits at four point three percent.
