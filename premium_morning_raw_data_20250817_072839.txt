1. 'Insult to constitution': Election Commission slams Rahul Gandhi's 'vote fraud' charge

PTC News Desk: The Election Commission of India on Sunday rejected Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi over his "vote chori" (vote theft) allegation. The poll body further accused the political parties of targetting voters while putting the onus on them.

The Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said, "When politics is being done by targeting the voters of India by keeping a gun on the shoulder of the Election Commission, today the Election Commission wants to make it clear to everyone that the Election Commission fearlessly stood like a rock with all the voters of all sections and all religions including the poor, rich, elderly, women, youth without any discrimination, is standing and will continue to stand."

"Every political party is registered with the Election Commission. How can the Commission discriminate between them? For us, all are equal," Kumar said. "The EC will not step back from its constitutional duty, regardless of which party is involved."

The EC exhorted all political parties to file claims and objections on draft electoral rolls in Bihar as 15 days still remain for it.

The Election Commission's remarks came hours after 1,300-km Voter Adhikar Yatra from Sasaram, Bihar led by Rahul Gandhi ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections.


2. European leaders to join Zelensky when he meets Trump at the White House

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish president Alexander Stubb were the first leaders to confirm they will join Mr Zelensky in Washington DC.

French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, and Nato chief Mark Rutte have also confirmed their attendance.

Downing Street would not comment on whether Sir Keir Starmer plans to travel to Washington to join other European leaders on Monday.

Mr Zelensky's Oval Office rendezvous with the US president will take place after Western allies meet for a coalition of the willing video call on Sunday afternoon.

The call will be hosted by Prime Minister Sir Keir, France's Mr Macron and Germany's Mr Merz.

The show of unity by European leaders comes as Mr Trump appears poised to urge the Ukrainian leader to agree to a Russian land grab of his country's territory, according to reports.

Several news outlets have reported Russian president Vladimir Putin has demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops, multiple reports said, attributing sources familiar with Mr Putin and Mr Trump's negotiations in Alaska on Friday.

Mr Trump is said to be inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelensky about it when they meet in the Oval Office.

The European leaders may also fear a repeat of Mr Zelensky's last visit to the White House at the end of February.

The tumultuous spat resulted in a souring of relations between the US and Ukraine, including a temporary cut off of American aid for the war effort.

Mr Trump appeared to change his position on how to end the war in Ukraine following his meeting with the Russian president on Friday.

Following the Alaska summit, the American leader suggested he wants to move straight to a full peace deal, rather than negotiating a ceasefire first.

The shift appears to echo the Russians' refusal to agree to ceasefire before engaging in peace talks.

Writing on social media on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian leader railed against Russia's refusal to lay down arms temporarily before agreeing to end the war.

Mr Zelensky said: "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing.

"This complicates the situation."

He added: "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades.

"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war."

Mr Zelensky is expected to attend Sunday afternoon's video call with leaders from the coalition of the willing, which is scheduled to take place at 2pm UK time.


3. Chinese woman among 14 suspects nabbed in Paranaque scam hub raid

A Chinese woman were among the 14 suspects who were arrested during a raid of an alleged scam hub in Paranaque City, police said Sunday.

In a press release, a team composed of operatives from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group's Anti-Organized Crime Unit (AOCU) and the Department of Justice-Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (DOJ-IACAT) served a search warrant at the Bayport West Garden Residences, located in NAIA Road, Brgy. Tambo, Para√±aque City on early Thursday morning.

The operation targeted what was reported as an online task job hub and resulted in the arrest of 14 persons, including a Chinese woman and the rescue of a 17-year old female teenager. The suspects were allegedly engaged in scamming activities when they were caught.

Authorities confiscated assorted information communication technology (ICT) devices, including 70 desktop computers, mobile phones, computer peripherals, a metal vault, dormitory pass IDs, and passports; and discovered cryptocurrency account numbers.

The suspects are facing charges for violating Republic Act 9208 (Anti -Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003 as amended by Republic Act 10364 (Expanded Human Trafficking Act of 2012) in relation to Republic Act 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012); and Republic Act 12010 (Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (AFASA).

The rescued minor was turned over to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) for appropriate intervention and disposition.

Online Task Job Scam

Police said the scheme typically operates through the online messaging application "Telegram" where the scammers send links to their intended victims. Each suspect is assigned to 600 Telegram accounts to contact potential victims.

Once the link is accessed, the victims are directed to a so-called "task job," which assigns simple online tasks such as liking the pages of hotel packages.

After the tasks are completed, the victims are instructed to open a Binance account - cryptocurrency account.

Upon successfully creating the account, the scammers then require the victims to deposit funds into it. The victims are subsequently directed to transfer the deposited funds into a Binance account allegedly managed by the arrested Chinese manager.

The scammers will lure victims that the transferred money will generate profit or collect interest, promising continuous growth of the investment. Once the victims are convinced to give a certain amount the suspects steal the money.

"I commend the CIDG Anti-Organized Crime Unit (AOCU) and DOJ-IACAT for their swift and responsive action that resulted in the arrests of the suspects, and the rescue of the minor victim. This underscores our unyielding fight against trafficking in persons, child abuse, and cybercrimes. With this, we significantly prevented future "online task job scam" from happening. Maraming Salamat sa inyo.", Police Brigadier Gen. Christopher Abrahano said. -- RF, GMA Integrated News


4. 9 Killed, 3 Missing As Flash Floods Sweep Through North China

Beijing: Nine people were killed and three others reported missing after a flash flood swept through a wild camping site in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, state-run media said on Sunday.

The disaster struck Saturday morning in the upstream area of a river in Urad Rear Banner in Bayannur City, leaving 13 campers unaccounted for.

As of Sunday evening, one person had been rescued while nine others were confirmed dead. Three campers remain missing, according to the city's emergency management bureau, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

More than 700 rescuers have been dispatched to the site urgently to search for the missing, the report said.

The Ministry of Emergency Management has stepped up operations to locate the missing and sent a work team to guide the operations, it said.

The ministry has also warned travellers during flood season to avoid undeveloped wilderness areas and exercise caution in geologically hazardous zones, the report added.


5. Again and again : Indybay

To the extent that we judge and condemn others and think that they are made of worse stuff than ourselves, we feed the energy that finds its fullest expression in genocide. Sociopathic and narcissistic leaders reflect back to us in extreme form the everyday dehumanization of those we condemn. Again and again

As long as thinking in terms of "us against them" prevails, genocide, as we are now seeing in Gaza, will continue to occur.

When something terrible happens, people often react and try to do something about it. When it is excessively terrible, however, resistance often fails because we cannot believe that such a thing is possible in our time. Or, precisely because the horror overwhelms us, we do not even look. In the case of the genocide in Gaza, the horror is well documented. Those who want to see can see. Not all information can be rationalized away by pointing to potentially fake images. This is how "Never again!" has become a cheap phrase that can be safely chanted at demonstrations "against the right" and then forgotten as soon as it really matters. Charles Eisenstein, who likes to argue on several levels of observation, sees the cause of the "again and again" -- the continuity of horror in world history -- primarily in a way of thinking firmly rooted in our unconscious, in categories of 'us' (good) and "them" (evil). If we could heal the wounds of our soul and take back the evil we think we see outside ourselves, there would be a chance for peace.

by Charles Eisenstein

[This article posted on 8/1/2025 is translated from the German on the Internet, https://www.manova.news/artikel/immer-wieder-ist-jetzt-2.]

It is a brutal irony: less than a century after the worst genocide in human history, the Holocaust, which wiped out six million Jews and prompted the world to vow "Never again!", we are now witnessing a new horror story, this time perpetrated by Jews themselves.

Although it is smaller in scale than other political mass murders since World War II -- in Cambodia, Uganda, or Rwanda -- it has another distinctive feature besides its irony: it is happening right before our eyes, on camera, blogged live and documented in real time. It is impossible to feign ignorance. At least, so it seems.

In reality, however, the truth continues to be hidden from us, and the methods used to conceal it are not significantly different from those that have always been used. This is the key to understanding why "never again" keeps happening... again... and again.

I have read various sources about the "war" in Gaza: Haaretz (an Israeli newspaper), Mondoweiss, Drop Site News, Chris Hedges, Caitlin Johnstone, Glenn Greenwald, and -- to be balanced -- the New York Times and The Scroll (a "pro-Israel" publication that presents a right-wing Israeli view of the Palestinian question. I put "pro-Israeli" in quotation marks because this nation is in fact destroying itself in the name of its own preservation.) These publications -- with the exception of the last two -- have documented in detail the horrors, the propaganda, the strategies, and the political history and context of the genocide.

Yes, I will use that word, even if the goal of the war is not to destroy every single inhabitant of Gaza. The pretext is the elimination of Hamas; the real goal is the ethnic cleansing of the area for Jewish settlements. Genocide is the collateral damage in the ruthless pursuit of that goal.

So far, at least 58,000 people have been killed in military attacks in Gaza (the number is likely much higher, as it does not include those buried under the rubble). Countless others have died of hunger and disease.

Despite extensive documentation of the horrific crimes against humanity in Gaza, many people -- including the majority of the Israeli population -- either do not believe this is happening or do not seem to care.

This is not because, as Caitlin Johnstone claims, they are "bad people" or "exhausting, insufferable narcissists." That is not an explanation that points to a way forward, but merely a loop back to the starting point.

If the problem were "bad people," then only a fool would hope that they would change. But "bad people" don't change -- only non-bad people are capable of that. The solution would then be to suppress them, imprison them, silence them, remove them, control them, humiliate them, destroy them, and make an example of them to deter other bad people. But that is precisely the basic attitude behind genocide.

After all, most Israelis believe that only bad people live in Gaza. At least that is what polls suggest, with a large majority believing that there are "no innocents in Gaza."

If you do not believe that bad people can be eradicated from the earth forever, then this diagnosis condemns us to experience "never again" over and over again.

Wouldn't it be better to understand why ordinary people, even friendly and generous people -- the kind who feed your cat when you're away -- support or tolerate heinous crimes that take place before our very eyes? If we understood that, perhaps we could prevent it.

Because the carnage is so public, many of us cry out in despair: "How, how, how can this be happening? Why are they doing this? How could we have allowed this to happen?" If anything is to change on this earth, these questions must be more than just expressions of despair. We must take them seriously. We must not be satisfied with convenient, false answers that vent our despair by directing it toward hatred of despicable people.

In fact, those who refuse to acknowledge the reality of what is happening are doing what humans always do. For them, the genocide is not happening before their eyes because they live in a narrative bubble where it is invisible.

They will say, "These videos are staged. These photos are fake. These stories are Hamas propaganda. The doctors reporting from Gaza are anti-Semites." Or they will say, "That's what happens in war." Or, "Gaza shouldn't have voted for Hamas; they have only themselves to blame and deserve to be punished for October 7." Or, "If they want the war to end, they should storm the tunnels and drive out Hamas."

And they actually believe this with all sincerity, even though it is contradictory. Massacres of civilians do not take place AND massacres of civilians are inevitable. Hunger is not used as a weapon of war AND hunger as a weapon of war is justified.

In other words, they are doing what most of us do all the time, albeit in a more extreme form. They select information and interpret it to maintain their beliefs, their identity, and their sense of belonging. I'm sorry, but these people are not just worse people. I don't mean to be condescending when I say "I'm sorry, but..." I'm genuinely sorry. I wish things were simpler. I wish the atrocities that Johnstone, Hedges, and others so courageously and tenaciously expose were simply the result of bad people doing bad things.

I wish we lived in a world where there were clear heroes and villains -- a world of orcs and elves, a fantasy world √† la "Starship Troopers," where the fundamental problem is an identifiable "them."

But it is precisely this way of thinking that creates the conditions for massacres. Who are the Palestinians if not "the others"? Who were the Jews in 1930s Europe if not "the others" onto whom all the evils of the continent could be projected? Who were the Tutsis in Rwanda, the "counterrevolutionary elements" during the Cultural Revolution, the witches of the Inquisition?

You may say, "There is a big difference between stirring up contempt for a weak, oppressed population in order to enable their slaughter, and stirring up contempt for the power that carries out that slaughter."

Sure. But take it one step further. What you are saying is, "This person or that person deserves contempt because..." That is the pattern of thinking. There is contempt and there are reasons for it. And so we are left with endless discussions about who deserves contempt and who does not, which wars are justified and which are not. When all parties agree that someone deserves contempt, it is easy for those in power to argue that it is the others. The agreement facilitates propaganda. That is why I say that war is always justified.

We can denounce all collective crimes -- whether genocide, abuse, exploitation, ecocide, or oppression -- without making an implicit diagnosis of the perpetrator that confirms that some people are inferior to the rest of us. For that is the principle that justifies the creation of the next class of victims.

The "us against them" pattern is older than history. It does not arise solely from "tribalism" and competition for scarce resources. The division into 'us' and "them" also occurs regularly within groups. As Ren√© Girard has shown, this is the original social crisis that arose even before civilization itself: cycles of revenge, division of society, followed by an outbreak of unifying sacrificial violence, through which social tensions that could divide society are dumped onto a relatively powerless, dehumanized underclass.

If we become accustomed to "us versus them" thinking, populations become vulnerable to manipulation by truly evil people: those unscrupulous, sociopathic individuals who so often rise to power in opaque systems.

All they have to do is point the finger at others (or identify them with the help of sophisticated propaganda and information control).

Mass psychology does the rest. These efforts would have little effect if it weren't for the ally of our inherited psychology, the ancient tendency to label an external enemy or an internal minority as "subhuman."

I know from experience that the view presented here will provoke hostility. I would like to save critics the trouble by anticipating the two most important criticisms for them. I call them "sympathetic to fascism" and "anti-Semitic idiot." Although they come from superficially opposing perspectives, what they have in common is far more significant.

Sympathetic to fascism: Charles, you give Israel a free pass for genocide. If the recent massacres in aid centers, the targeted killing of children, the murder of journalists, the use of hunger as a weapon, or the blockade of medical supplies don't convince you, then nothing will. By humanizing a nation of child murderers and mass murderers, you raise false hopes that they will end the genocide on their own. You excuse and enable pure evil, possibly because, as a privileged white American, you are not one of its victims. Only by calling evil by its name and stirring up anger and revulsion toward its perpetrators (who deserve nothing better) can we mobilize a mass movement to end the genocide.

Anti-Semitic fool: Charles, it's sad that you too have fallen victim to pro-Hamas propaganda. The so-called "Palestinian rights" are nothing more than veiled hatred of Jews. What happened to your critical mind? Israel is surrounded by enemies who have sworn to wipe the Jews off the face of the earth. It's in the Hamas charter. The Iranian leaders have said so. Islamic doctrine also states that it is forbidden for a Muslim to negotiate with a Jew unless it is a ruse. Islam is a religion of hatred and evil. Don't kid yourself and, for God's sake, don't deceive others. Your appeals for peace only play into the hands of an irreconcilable, malicious enemy.

Both critics agree on the fundamental problem: evil people. They merely disagree on their identity. The first criticism is also based on a widespread misunderstanding: that anyone who does not respond with hatred or call for punishment cannot understand how abhorrent the crimes are and must therefore agree that they should continue.

But the reason I call for compassion is exactly the opposite -- because I believe these atrocities are happening and that compassion -- understanding why -- is the only lasting way to stop them. Understanding does not mean excusing.

Once again: There are indeed "bad people," by which I mean people who are so sociopathic or narcissistic that they have little prospect of improvement, especially as long as they have power over others. However, they are few, a tiny minority. There is no society of sociopaths; there are only sociopathic societies in which historical conditions reinforce humanity's almost universal "us-them" programming.

"Us-them" thinking is not just about differences. The 'us' consists of complete human beings, while the "them" includes those who lack an essential human quality (morality, intelligence, virtue, decency). That is why they are so often compared to animals. To the extent that we judge and condemn others and think that they are made of worse stuff than ourselves, we feed the energy that finds its fullest expression in genocide. Sociopathic and narcissistic leaders reflect back to us in extreme form the everyday dehumanization of those we condemn. They are more a symptom than a cause of the horrors they inflict.

The "us-them" mindset explains why not-bad people do bad things.

Let us now return to the agonizing question: "Why do they do this? How can this happen in plain sight?" The real question is: "Why are so many unwilling to see this?"

Yes, indeed. Why is it so hard to admit that you were wrong? Why is it so hard to admit that you caused harm or stood on the side of the oppressors? The main reason underlying many forms of cognitive bias stems from an original insecurity rooted in our "us-them" thinking.

It is this: perhaps we have misunderstood everything. Perhaps we are the bad people. Perhaps we are less than fully human, perhaps we lack essential human qualities. People have an instinctive fear of being placed in the victim class of subhumans, of being the "others" who are burned at the stake, lynched, ethnically cleansed, or exterminated. In a climate where one side or the other must fall into the category of inferior human beings, we will fight stubbornly to avoid that fate. We will do everything we can to prove that we are right and good, just, ethical, and moral.

This intellectual climate must change if we ever want to fulfill the promise of "never again."

If we can agree that good people can be involved in terrible things, then we can overcome the shame that prevents us from seeing the terrible things we do.

Because these things no longer mean that we are not good people. We are still worthy of love. We will not be cast out. We will not take the place of those we have persecuted. And the endless cycle of history will end.

This is not just about the genocide in Gaza. All the suffering that power inflicts on people and the planet happens behind a veil of ignorance. The narrative of this ignorance devalues, dehumanizes, and desecrates everything it destroys. But when you ask an immigrant who has been arrested in an immigration raid, or a resident of Gaza, a gang member, an addict, a welfare recipient, a police officer, a soldier, or anyone else who has been placed in this category, "What is it like to be you? What is your story?", then 'us' and "them" dissolve.

You realize that their story could have been your own, had it not been for God's grace. Compassion and diversity can flourish. You may still have conflicting interests and views, but the search for a solution no longer takes place in a vacuum of ignorance, in the illusion that the other is less human than you are.

The "us-them" mentality is still deeply rooted. People ask, "So what's your solution for Palestine?" I don't have one. Or rather, I do have one (I described it last year, a version of "two states, one homeland"), but it is completely unworkable under the current circumstances. Without a break from the "us-them" mindset, no humane solution is practicable, and no practicable solution is humane.

We must therefore change the foundation that makes things feasible. That foundation is our beliefs, our stories, our myths, and the unfinished personal and societal healing that breathes life into them. It wasn't just stupid, untrue beliefs about us and them that got us into these stories. Behind them lie traumas and an entire evolutionary path of consciousness toward overcoming them.

Since "us-them" thinking -- the pattern of exclusion -- is so deeply woven into our cultural DNA, this also applies to genocide. Perhaps it will end like the Holocaust: with the perpetrators finding themselves on the losing side of a war against evil and their leaders being led to the gallows amid cries of "Never again!"

To win such a war, one should, of course, portray the supporters of the other side in the worst possible light. As monsters. As evil people. But that would only end this genocide. It would not end genocide as such.

To do that, we must complete the evolutionary journey of consciousness, away from us and them, away from separation. We must work seriously to heal our wounds so that we do not pass them on as resentment and revenge. And we must listen to the avatars of this new consciousness who appear again and again throughout history to use their words and their bodies to bring it about. "Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do."

6. Business Technology News: The Best Printers Of 2025

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.

Here are five things in business technology news that happened this week and how they affect your business.

Did you miss them?

Ray Smith of the Wall Street Journal reported that companies are going back to the "old-school" method of job interviews: face-to-face. As generative AI becomes more embedded in hiring, companies are rethinking how they conduct interviews - balancing automation with authenticity. (Source: Wall Street Journal)

According to the report, research has shown that in some instances, job seekers have used AI tools to cheat to appear more qualified, particularly in fields such as software engineering. Employers are changing up their interviewing process utilizing AI-powered screening to review resumes, then proceed with an in-person interview to better gauge soft skills and cultural fit. AI is making hiring faster and more scalable, but companies are learning that too much automation can feel impersonal. The future of interviews may be hybrid - tech-enhanced but still human at heart.

Customer service platform Zendesk has integrated GPT-5 into its Resolution Platform to supercharge customer support with smarter automation and faster, more accurate responses. According to the company this move enhances Zendesk's AI agents, Copilot, and App Builder, making support interactions more seamless and effective. With GPT-5, improvements include fewer escalations and faster execution. Additionally, Zendesk says that its rigorous testing "ensures GPT-5 avoids hallucinations and only acts when confident." (Source: Small Business Trends)

For the past couple of years I've been writing about how big companies are investing in AI, mostly for enhancing their customer service applications. I've also been telling my SMB clients to be patient: this stuff will eventually start trickling down. And it is. Zendesk - and other great customer service platforms for small businesses like my client Talkdesk Express - are using AI to shorten resolution times, provide more accurate answer to customer questions and better support human customer service representatives in their jobs. And they're just getting started.

Generative AI is reshaping the online shopping experience by streamlining the checkout process, making it faster, simpler, and more integrated. For example, platforms like Perplexity now allow users to buy items (e.g., concert tickets, travel) directly within chat using PayPal or Venmo, without having to visit external sites and frictionless payments are simplifying the buying process to boost conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment. The Financial Times reported that an integrated check-out system will be supported by OpenAI - potentially partnering with Shopify to enable full transactions inside ChatGPT, though neither company has confirmed this. (Source: CNBC)

According to the above report experts say this shift could dramatically alter the retail model, with merchants paying commissions to AI platforms for in-chat sales where AI isn't just recommending products - it's closing the sale. Of course, it's the big box retailers who are leaning into this stuff right now. But it's not too hard to see how these technologies will soon be in the hands of smaller businesses selling online to provide a better shopping experience for their customers. Look for the bigger ecommerce platforms like Amazon, eBay and others to be making these tools available for their merchants.

Business Technology News #4 - The best laser printers for 2025.

According to PCMag, here's a sample of their list of the best laser printers for various needs - home, office, color, mono, and budget - based on speed, print quality, usability, and cost per page. Their pick for best color laser is Brother's MFC-L3780CDW model priced at $569.99. The best color laser for your budget is the Brother HL-L3295CDW for $429.98. The best color laser for small offices is the Xerox C235 for $400.00. On the higher-end price wise, the best color printer for large workgroups is the HP Color LaserJet Enterprise MFP M480f for $1,000. PCMag's reviews are based on decades of testing and emphasize real-world performance. (Source: PCMag)

And yet, even in 2025, I still have trouble connecting to my printer.

Researchers from Zenity Labs revealed serious vulnerabilities in popular AI agents - showing how attackers can hijack them to steal data, manipulate workflows, and impersonate users. Their findings showed that Agents could be tricked into poisoning knowledge sources or altering behavior. Attackers could gain memory persistence, allowing ongoing access and manipulation. (Source: Cybersecurity Dive)

"This opens the door to sabotage, operational disruption, and long-term misinformation," warned Greg Zemlin, product marketing manager at Zenity Labs. In their demonstrations, researchers highlighted the following vulnerabilities: Prompt injection via email compromised ChatGPT and accessed Google Drive; Microsoft Copilot Studio leaked entire CRM databases; Salesforce Einstein rerouted customer messages to attacker-controlled emails. This research emphasizes the urgent need for stronger safeguards as AI agents become more embedded in business operations. Looks like AI may be taking jobs away from some people, but providing plenty of opportunities for hackers.

7. Pope offers prayers for flood victims in Pakistan, Nepal, and India - Vatican News

After praying the Angelus in Freedom Square in Castel Gandolfo, Pope Leo expressed his closeness to the people in Pakistan, India, and Nepal who have been affected by severe flooding.

The Pope shared his prayers "for the victims and their families, and for all those who are suffering as a result of this calamity." More than 300 people have been killed in northwest Pakistan, India-administered Kashmir, and Nepal after two days of heavy rain and flash floods.

In Pakistan, officials report rescue teams have evacuated more than 3,500 tourists trapped in areas hit by the floods since Thursday. Over 10 villages in the Nuner region were destroyed by the flooding, and landslides and devastated roads kept workers from reaching communities.

Reiterating his ongoing calls for peace in the world, Pope Leo expressed his desire that efforts to end wars and promote peace come to fruition and that, "in every negotiation, the common good of peoples may always be given priority."

In the midst of the summer months, the Pope said he has received news of different cultural and evangelization initiatives, sometimes organized in places where people vacation. He pointed out how encouraging it is "to see how a passion for the Gospel inspires the creativity and commitment of groups and associations of all ages."

The Pope used the example of the youth mission that was held recently in Riccione and he expressed his gratitude for everyone who helped promote and participate in these types of events.


8. Harry and William's pal in 'dilemma' over who should be godfather

By GINA KALSI, FEMAIL REPORTER and JESSICA GREEN, ASSOCIATE FEMAIL EDITOR

The Duke of Westminster is said to be in a 'delicate dilemma' after considering whether to ask both Prince Harry and Prince William to be his daughter's godfathers.

Billionaire aristocrat Hugh Grosvenor, 34, and his wife Olivia, 32, welcomed their first child, Cosima Florence Grosvenor, last month, a year after the pair had a lavish wedding, in which the Prince of Wales was an usher.

Grosvenor, who is King Charles's godson and known as Hughie to his friends, is close to both Harry and William and is thought to be the only one of their friends who was chosen to be a godparent to both of their sons, Prince George, 12, and Prince Archie, six.

Friends of the Duke and Duchess of Westminster say they haven't made a final decision on who will be Cosima's godparents, but it is understood that William, 43, will be a godfather, according to the Sunday Times.

However, it was reported that the new father is still considering whether to also ask Prince Harry, amid ongoing tensions between him and the Royal Family since the Sussexes upped sticks to California, leaving their position as senior royals in 2020.

It is believed that both brothers sent their congratulations to the couple after their daughter was born on July 27. A date has not currently been set for the christening.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex did not attend Grosvenor's wedding at Chester Cathedral or his opulent reception bash at Eaton Hall last June, while William was invited to be a part of the big day, greeting guests and guiding them to their seats before the ceremony.

It was later revealed by the newspaper that the Duke of Westminster had planned to invite Harry and his wife, but was conscious that the rift between the brothers might cause further tension and overshadow the couple's nuptials.

The Duke of Westminster is reportedly considering whether to ask both Prince Harry and Prince William (pictured in 2018) to be his daughter's godfathers

At the time, a friend of the brothers told the Times: 'It's incredibly sad it has come to this. Hugh is one of very few close friends of William and Harry's who has maintained strong bonds and a line of communication with both.

'He wishes they could put their heads together and patch things up, but realises it's unlikely to happen before the wedding.

'He wanted to avoid anything overshadowing the day, especially for Olivia, and doesn't want any awkwardness.'

It was later reported that sources close to the Sussexes suggested Harry and Meghan had received a 'save the date' card for the June wedding, but they had decided not to attend because it would be 'too awkward'.

It is understood that the brothers have not spoken to each other since Queen Elizabeth's death in September 2022, where they were seen putting their conflict behind them and acting in a civil way towards each other.

The occasion marked Meghan's last time visiting the UK - with Harry returning sporadically on his own.

The rift between the Sussexes and the rest of the Firm has only grown as the couple publicly chastised the Firm.

In his tell-all memoir Spare, Harry described how his position left him seemingly bubbling with resentment, writing: 'I was the shadow, the support, the Plan B. I was brought into the world in case something happened to Willy.

'I was summoned to provide back-up, distraction, diversion and if necessary, a spare part. Kidney, perhaps. Blood transfusion. Speck of bone marrow.'

The Duke of Sussex has not seen his father, King Charles, since February last year, when he travelled to London from the US after Buckingham Palace announced the monarch's cancer diagnosis.

The father-of-two is expected to travel to the UK again next month to attend the WellChild awards, a charity which supports ill children, however it is not known whether he will meet up with the King.

In an interview with the BBC in May, Harry said: 'There is no point continuing to fight any more. Of course, some members of my family will never forgive me for writing a book. Of course, they will never forgive lots of things. But I would love a reconciliation.'

He then added: 'I don't know how much longer my father has. He won't speak to me.'

The Daily Mail contacted a spokesperson for the Duke of Westminster for comment.

Once considered one of the country's most eligible bachelors, Hugh became an instant billionaire when he inherited his title and control of the historic Grosvenor Estate aged just 25, after his father died from a heart attack in 2016.

His property company, Grosvenor Group, owns hundreds of acres of land in Mayfair and Belgravia, as well as major city centre developments such as Liverpool's One shopping centre.

The duke donated ¬£12.5 million to the UK's Covid relief effort in 2020, including funds for NHS Charities Together and for medical research and development.

In April, the Duke and Duchess of Westminster joined Prince William and Prince George to cheer on Aston Villa in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League against Paris St Germain.

It was their first public appearance after announcing they were expecting a baby.

Hugh and Olivia showed their support, each wearing matching burgundy scarves with Aston Villa emblazoned in white across the length of the neckwear.

Earlier this year, a spokesman for the pair said: 'The Duchess is expecting a baby in the summer. The couple are delighted with the news and are very much looking forward to starting a family together.'

Last month, the happy couple also revealed their daughter had been named Cosima Florence Grosvenor.

A spokesperson for the pair said: 'The Duke and Duchess of Westminster are thrilled to announce the birth of their baby daughter. Both the duchess and Cosima are doing well. The Duke and Duchess now look forward to spending this special time together as a family.'

The pair announced their engagement in April 2023, after being together for two years.

They decided to marry at Chester Cathedral, before inviting around 400 guests including Princess Eugenie and TV producer Phil Redmond, to go to a lavish reception at the Grosvenor family seat, Eaton Hall, just outside Chester.

The Duke paid for free ice cream, gelato and sorbet for Cheshire locals from three local independent cafes so they could join in the celebration.

And a staggering 100,000 flowers - all paid for by the Duke - were planted throughout the city and donated to charity following the ceremony.

No expense was spared as Olivia arrived at the Cathedral in a vintage 1930 8-litre Bentley owned by the Grosvenor estate.

The bride's veil was designed by Emma Victoria Payne and featuring an embroidery design which incorporated floral motifs from her great-great-grandmother's veil from around 1880.

Her dress was made by the same designer and she accessorised with blue shoes and the Faberge Myrtle Leaf Tiara made for Grosvenor brides to wear on their wedding day, which has been in the family since 1906.


9. European leaders to join Zelenskyy when he meets Trump at the White House

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish president Alexander Stubb were the first leaders to confirm they will join Mr Zelensky in Washington DC.

Mr Zelenskyy's Oval Office rendezvous with the US president will take place after Western allies meet for a coalition of the willing video call on Sunday afternoon.

The call will be hosted by British leader Keir Starmer, France's Emmanuel Macron and Mr Merz.

Downing Street would not comment on whether Sir Keir plans to travel to Washington to join other European leaders on Monday.

The show of unity by European leaders comes as Mr Trump appears poised to urge the Ukrainian leader to agree to a Russian land grab of his country's territory, according to reports.

Several news outlets have reported Russian president Vladimir Putin has demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops, several news outlets said, attributing sources familiar with Mr Putin and Mr Trump's negotiations in Alaska on Friday.

Mr Trump is said to be inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelenskyy about it when they meet in the Oval Office

The European leaders may also fear a repeat of Mr Zelenskyy's last visit to the White House at the end of February.

The tumultuous spat resulted in a souring of relations between the US and Ukraine.

11. Mother Charged After 14-Year-Old Girl Was Struck 'Multiple Times' with Stanley Cup in Attack Outside Summer School

Toni Monroe, who is the mother of the 15-year-old, was arraigned in court on Aug. 13, having been charged in connection with the assault

A mother has been charged with assault after she allegedly hit and injured a teenager with a Stanley Cup at a school in New York.

Toni Monroe, 35, allegedly struck a 14-year-old girl "multiple times" with a water bottle during an altercation between the student and her 15-year-old daughter on Aug. 12 at Brentwood High School in Long Island, the Suffolk County police said in a news release.

Police stated that the 14-year-old student was exiting the school when she and a 15-year-old girl exchanged words at around 11 a.m. local time. Monroe, who is the mother of the 15-year-old, then allegedly struck the 14-year-old several times with a metal water bottle before a security guard broke up the altercation.

A short time later, the mother was arrested in the parking lot, according to the police news release. The injured 14-year-old was transported to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.

The injured teenager has been identified as Brentwood High School student Madison Evans, per ABC 7 New York.

In footage obtained by the outlet, two teenage girls are seen in a heated exchange at the school, before an individual believed to be Monroe is heard telling one of the girls, who appears to be her daughter, "Give me your Stanley." She then seems to strike the other girl repeatedly with the Stanley Cup, as she is heard screaming.

Evans received a bloody gash on her forehead in the alleged attack, which required 17 stitches, per ABC 7 New York

"She threw a punch, I threw a punch back and we started fighting and her mom just came in and started beating me with the cup," Evans said, per NBC New York. "Next thing you know, I get pushed into the school and I saw blood dripping ... I saw blood all over my hands."

Monroe was charged with assault in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child following the incident.

At her arraignment in court on Aug. 13, Monroe's lawyer claimed that she was at the school at the time to attend a meeting about her daughter being bullied, per ABC 7 New York. The lawyer also denied that Monroe punched the girl, alleging that Evans attacked her daughter first.

Monroe was released after the arraignment with supervision and signed an order of protection to stay away from Evans, according to the outlet.

"We are aware of the incident that occurred yesterday during dismissal involving two students and a parent," Brentwood High School said in a statement on Aug. 13, per News 12 Long Island. "The safety and well-being of our students is always our highest priority, and this type of behavior is unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our schools."

PEOPLE has reached out to Brentwood High School for comment.

13. Ukraine and allies left scrambling as Trump shifts toward Putin after Alaska summit

LONDON -- Ukraine and its allies were scrambling Sunday to respond to President Donald Trump's apparent shift toward Vladimir Putin's hardline position after their summit in Alaska.

European leaders announced that they would join Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday as they seek to navigate America's new approach to ending the war.

Trump signaled Saturday that he was reversing his insistence on a ceasefire and instead pursuing a permanent peace deal -- aligning the United States with the Kremlin rather than Kyiv and its European backers.

As Ukraine and Europe work out how best to move forward, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von de Leyen, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that they would be joining Zelenskyy, perhaps hoping to ensure there is no repeat of his last Oval Office meeting.

"The trip will serve as an exchange of information" with Trump, Merz' office said. "The talks will address, among other things, security guarantees, territorial issues, and continued support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression."

The news came ahead of a virtual meeting of the so-called "coalition of the willing," which includes more than 30 countries working together to support Ukraine.

While Trump's reversal on pursuing a ceasefire before fuller peace talks fueled alarm on the continent, he did appear to have taken a step toward another position more aligned with the wishes of Ukraine and Europe.

Trump directly engaged with Zelenskyy and European leaders by phone early Saturday morning about the U.S. taking part in a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a deal with Russia, two senior administration officials and three sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News.

"European and American security guarantees were discussed," one source familiar with the discussions said. "U.S. troops on the ground was not discussed or entertained by [Trump]."

The security guarantees would be made in the scenario that Russia were to invade Ukraine, again, after a would-be peace deal, the sources said. The sources said that those protections, as discussed by the White House, would not include NATO membership -- despite European leaders saying in a joint statement Saturday that Ukraine should be given the right to seek NATO membership.

But it was clear that the summit had left Ukraine feeling uneasy.

Zelenskyy warned that the Russian leader was complicating efforts to end the war by refusing to halt the brutal fighting before holding further talks.

"Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing. This complicates the situation," Zelenskyy said in a post on X late Saturday.

For civilians on the ground, still under Russian attack even as the diplomatic maneuvering played out, it was not just the substance but the optics of the Alaska talks that caused frustration.

"I was hoping that the U.S. wouldn't roll out the red carpet to the enemy," Kyiv resident Natalya Lypei said Saturday. "How can you welcome a tyrant like this?"


14. Trump-Putin Summit: What We Know

Here are the outcomes of a summit meeting on Ukraine between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, based on statements from Saturday:

- No ceasefire -

Ukraine and European leaders had urged Trump to push for an immediate ceasefire, but this was not agreed to at the summit.

Trump said it was determined by all that the best way to end the "horrific war... is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up".

This stance appears to be a victory for Putin, whose army has made recent progress in eastern Ukraine and who has called for a peace deal that would address what he says are the "root causes" of the conflict, notably the prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine.

According to Kyiv, Russian forces launched 85 drones and one missile at Ukraine overnight Friday to Saturday -- including during the meeting -- while Russia claimed to have taken two more villages in the east of Ukraine.

- No 'severe consequences' -

Ahead of the summit, Trump had threatened "severe consequences" if Putin failed to agree to a ceasefire.

Trump could impose tariffs of up to 500 percent on any country that helps Russia's war effort as part of so-called "secondary sanctions", according to Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham.

But when asked about this by Fox News after the talks, Trump said that, "because of what happened today, I think I don't have to think about that now".

European leaders, meanwhile, said they would keep pressuring Russia, including with further sanctions, until "there is a just and lasting peace".

- Nothing on land concessions -

Ukraine's biggest fear ahead of the Alaska summit was that the United States would push it to give up territories currently occupied by Russia, which comprise around 20 percent of its land, including Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.

Trump expressed support during a call with Zelensky and European leaders after the summit for a proposal by Putin to take full control of two largely Russian-held Ukrainian regions in exchange for freezing the frontline in two others, an official briefed on the talks told AFP.

Putin "de facto demands that Ukraine leave Donbas," an area consisting of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine, the source said.

In exchange, Russian forces would halt their offensive in the Black Sea port region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, where the main cities are still under Ukrainian control.

- Security guarantees -

Guarantees to secure any future peace deal were not mentioned in the Trump-Putin final declaration.

But Trump told Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders that a NATO-style guarantee for Kyiv could be on the table, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and a diplomatic source said -- but without actual NATO membership for Ukraine.

France, Britain and others said they could contribute troops as peace deal guarantors in Ukraine, but not on the frontline.

- Possible three-way meeting -

Trump said he would meet Zelensky in Washington on Monday, and said three-way talks between himself, Putin and Zelensky could be scheduled later.

He had said earlier that a deal to end the war depended on Zelensky alone.

But Zelensky said that Russia refusing to accept a ceasefire "complicates the situation", and questioned its willingness to achieve a lasting peace.


15. Trump Media's $2 Billion Bitcoin Purchase Creates Stock Surge

President Donald Trump's media group, Trump Media, made headlines in July when it purchased a staggering $2 billion in bitcoin and securities.

Trump Media made the bold move as a follow-up to its announcement made in May, when the company declared it had raised $2.5 billion in funding to make the purchase -- all part of a plan for Trump Media to become a bitcoin treasury company, as reported by Yahoo Finance.

Devin Nunes, CEO and president of Trump Media, described the purchase as a means to "[rigorously implement] our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan. These assets help insure our company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere."

Trump Media's massive bitcoin purchase not only shored up enough crypto to facilitate the company's bitcoin treasury plan, it also gave shares of Trump Media a boost in the stock market. Following the $2 billion acquisition, shares of Trump Media increased by 5.6% -- or $1.04, to an overall total of $19.71 -- after a bumpy 2025 that has seen the company's stock dip by 42%, per CBS News.

Considering investing in Trump Media? Despite its previously-rocky standing on the stock market, having its own bitcoin treasury could radically benefit the company for investors. Specifically, if bitcoin values continue to rise, so too would Trump Media's holdings, thus benefitting Trump Media shareholders.

Additionally, having that massive level of liquidity helps to protect (in some degree) Trump Media investors from the kind of significant loses it had suffered earlier this year, per AInvest. Also, as Fortune noted, purchasing shares of Trump Media allows for a kind of indirect exposure to the crypto and digital-asset market, in case you're a skittish investor who doesn't want to take the full dive into the world of crypto.

It's important to remember that Trump Media, President Trump and bitcoin remain volatile entities, especially in this era of economic and regulatory uncertainty. Investing in Trump Media would definitely be a speculative move -- you should be aware of yours risk tolerance before betting on such combustive (but potentially rewarding) investments.

What this means for investors is that while Trump Media will continue to be a high-risk investment, its level of high-reward has increased significantly with its efforts to create its own bitcoin treasury -- and the financial independence that level of liquidity provides.


16. Man receives electric shock at ATM in TN's Kancheepuram

Chennai, Aug 17 (SocialNews.XYZ) A man received an electric shock while withdrawing money from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram on Sunday, triggering panic.

The incident raised serious safety concerns among residents, prompting police action and urgent directions to the bank.

The victim, Venkatesan (35), a resident of Kamman Street, had gone to the vegetable market in the morning with his eight-year-old son.

Needing cash, he stopped at the HDFC bank's ATM located near the Head Post Office.

After inserting his card and beginning to key in his PIN, he suddenly received an electric shock through the keypad.

At first unsure if it was a genuine shock, Venkatesan attempted to re-enter his PIN, only to be hit by a much stronger jolt that left his right hand severely affected.

Shaken and in pain, he quickly exited the booth with his son and rushed to the Kancheepuram Government Hospital, where he was admitted for treatment. News of the incident spread quickly, creating tension in the locality.

Police from the Vishnu Kanchi station arrived at the scene and inspected the ATM.

Using a tester, officers confirmed that the keypad area was indeed leaking electricity. Though the leakage was of low voltage, police clarified it was sufficient to cause painful shocks, but not life-threatening injuries.

Reports soon emerged that others had also experienced minor shocks at the same ATM in recent days while entering their PINs.

Although no serious injuries had been reported earlier, the recurrence of such incidents alarmed locals.

Many began avoiding the faulty machine altogether, preferring to use other ATMs.

Some residents even resorted to using pens or other objects to press keys, wary of further electric jolts.

The police have since notified HDFC Bank management of the hazardous fault and instructed them to immediately repair the machine to prevent further incidents.

Locals, meanwhile, have urged authorities and banks to carry out routine checks of ATM facilities to ensure user safety.


17. Trump-Putin summit has brought the outline of a peace deal into view

President Donald Trump is likely to meet a chorus of 'I told you so' upon his return to slow-news Washington in August. His protestation that the meeting with Vladimir Putin was 'ten out of ten' and highly productive will sound hollow to those who had, along with President Trump himself, hoped for an instant cease-fire or even an outline settlement.

In truth, the picture is more mixed, depending on the issue one chooses to focus on when considering the negotiating process with a little more distance. The US, Ukraine and Western Europe, seem to have lost one preliminary battle in terms of process. But then, they may not have been in a position to win on that point.

For months, the US President has demanded a cease-fire. It might be a truce of 30 days, but would likely extend as substantive negotiations about the actual political settlement progress.

Given its present dominance on the ground, Moscow has rejected this sequencing, demanding a settlement, or an outline for a settlement, first, before a ceasefire can take hold. This is logical from the perspective of the Kremlin.

If a potential settlement does not meet Putin's broad demands for Ukrainian neutralisation and parts of its territory, then the alternative is what it has been since the beginning of the 'Special Military Operation' on 24 February 2022. That quite simply consists of the use of military force as a means to secure the desired political objectives in the mode of 19th century imperialism.

While the West has adopted ever tighter sanctions against Russia and has been quite effective in boosting Ukraine's ability to withstand the military onslaught through the delivery of military aid, it has not had the ability to remove the military option for Moscow as a means of realising its goals.

The reason is twofold. First, it is clear that the West, or Nato, cannot become directly engaged militarily, countering military aggression with collective defence of Ukraine at the risk of launching World War III. Hence, there is no prospect to remove the military option for Putin through the threat or reality of a military response.

Second, and critically, the global system of collective security has collapsed. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, virtually all states contributed to the nearly absolute economic and diplomatic isolation of Iraq. Later, the UN Security Council even mandated the use of force.

Sanctions can only work if all participate. But now, it is only the West that has acted against open aggression and in defence of the supposedly universal principle that the international use of force must be resisted and reversed. The states of the Global South, including the most powerful members of the BRICS Group, assert that the invasion of Ukraine is a European, or Western problem that does not involve them.

This means that sanctions are no longer the uniquely powerful and decisive tool they used to be. When balanced against the perceived interest of a revisionist power like Russia under Putin, the costs imposed by sanctions still do not outweigh the supposed gains of completing the aggressive war, at least for the next few years.

The quite recent attempt to opt for third-party sanctions against states that undermine the Western sanctions against Russia represents an attempt to overcome this problem. If the Global South does not want to participate in sanctions, we will force them to do so.

The trouble with this option is that it does not only disrupt relations between third states and Moscow. It also disrupts relations between the West and the targets of third party sanctions.

In finally imposing such measures against India when Russia kept resisting the call for a cease-fire, President Trump has admitted that he cannot at this point afford to aim for the more decisive target, China. Having just extended the period of negotiations for a critical trade deal with Beijing, he cannot at the same time sanction it over its support for Russia.

There is some room for increasing economic pressure on Moscow by seizing assets abroad or adopting more third-party sanctions. But this would not immediately impel Vladimir Putin to experience a change of heart over Ukraine and cease firing, although even greater economic pressure may have an effect in the longer term.

If there is no military option, and if sanctions in themselves will not end the conflict, then the only available avenue is diplomacy. But diplomacy can only yield a settlement if both sides in the conflict are ready to settle.

Trump has forced Volodomyr Zelensky - against his better judgement - to accept the prospect of both a ceasefire and a settlement, but he lacks similar power over Putin. Hence, he has been unable to extract a ceasefire as a price for substantive negotiations from the Kremlin. This does mean that Putin has chalked up a procedural victory - his demand for an agreement of at least the base-points for a settlement before a truce will be granted still prevails, even after Anchorage.

In addition to the failure to silence the sound of arms, the Alaskan adventure will now also likely be criticised as having failed to advance a substantive settlement. This criticism from the Europeans is rather hypocritical. After all, they have insisted all along with President Zelensky that no substantive agreement can be offered by Trump without the involvement and agreement by Ukraine. It seems unfair to criticise the US for having failed to do just that.

Rather, the White House claims that the summit has clarified areas where agreement is possible, and 'one or two' critical points of disagreement that remain. In his Fox interview upon the conclusion of the summit, Trump noted that it was now for Zelensky to decide how much he is willing to give in order to end the slaughter.

It is something of an indictment that it has taken a top-table effort to identify the critical areas of disagreement that remain. This would of course have been the essential task for Steve Witkoff and his five missions to Moscow thus far. It is rumoured that Witkoff somewhat misrepresented the extent of flexibility Putin was willing to grant, leading to the instant decision to convene the summit the minute he left the Kremlin last week.

Despite the outcry over the exclusion of Zelensky from Alaska, it was right to keep him away from what turned out to be a venture to seek to understand the Russian position better and perhaps to test Putin's resolve. An angry shouting match between two or three Presidents might have otherwise resulted, throwing the negotiating process back. Instead, Trump has now offered Zelensky, the UK and the EU states the opportunity to help find acceptable ways of overcoming the points of deadlock.

It is not yet known what the areas of major disagreement with Moscow revealed at the summit were. Presumably, this includes the issue of the territorial delimitation of the ceasefire line that will likely become frozen as a de facto border over time. The issue of land swaps was somewhat loosely raised by President Trump in the run-up to Alaska.

In fact, Zelensky has already accepted that territorial change will need to be reflected in a settlement, provided this does not imply a formal legal recognition of that outcome. Moscow, on the other hand, may still demand more territory than it has captured thus far. Some reports suggest that Putin offered to freeze the front lines in two provinces, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - if Ukraine surrendered the entirety of the Donbas. If the Kremlin is willing to 'swap' territory, then the price would likely be de jure recognition of its annexations obtained through force. This is difficult or impossible to deliver for Ukraine and the West. However, it is not impossible to come up with ways to circumvent this problem, and Anchorage may well focus creative minds on this issue.

The second sticking point that likely remains is that of security guarantees for Ukraine. Nato membership is out, as is the opposing vision of Putin for a fully neutral and militarily incapacitated Ukraine. Again, the summit may well have helped focus the US mediators on what can be offered to bridge the gap between the sides.

When seen from that perspective, the expedition to Alaska was a risky move for Trump in terms of his reputation. There was no ceasefire and it was unlikely that there would be one. Still, it was a necessary step in terms of the overall negotiating process.

Putin ended the summit by maintaining that Moscow's fundamental and supposedly legitimate interests must be respected in a settlement. His reference to addressing the root causes of the conflict is code for his long list of demands that cannot be accepted. However, there now exists a top-level format where the sides can more seriously explore whether a settlement, which must come eventually, can be found even now and even in relation to the remaining critical points of disagreement, before even more lives are lost.

19. 'A fear pandemic': Immigration raids push patients into telehealth

But in his 40 years as a pediatrician in Southern California serving those too poor to afford care, including many immigrant families, Sweidan said he's never seen a drop-off in patient visits like this.

"They are scared to come to the offices. They're getting sicker and sicker," said Sweidan, who specializes in neonatology and runs five clinics in Los Angeles and Orange counties. "And when they are near collapsing, they go to the ER because they have no choice."

In the last two months, he has sent young children to the emergency room because their parents worked up the courage to call his office only after several days of high fever. He said he attended to a 14-year-old boy in the ER who was on the verge of a diabetic coma because he'd run out of insulin, his parents too frightened to venture out for a refill.

Sweidan had stopped offering telehealth visits after the COVID-19 pandemic, but he and other health care providers have brought them back as ramped-up immigration enforcement drives patients without legal status -- and even their U.S. citizen children -- deeper into the shadows.

Patients in need of care are increasingly scared to seek it after Trump rescinded a Biden-era policy that barred immigration officials from conducting operations in "sensitive" areas such as schools, hospitals, and churches. Clinics and health plans have taken a page out of their COVID playbooks, revamping tested strategies to care for patients scared to leave the house.

Sara Rosenbaum, professor emerita of health law and policy at George Washington University, said she's heard from clinic administrators and industry colleagues who have experienced a substantial drop in in-person visits among immigrant patients.

"I don't think there's a community health center in the country that is not feeling this," Rosenbaum said.

At St. John's Community Health clinics in the Los Angeles area, which serve an estimated 30,000 patients without legal status annually, virtual visits have skyrocketed from roughly 8% of appointments to about 25%, said Jim Mangia, president and chief executive officer. The organization is also registering some patients for in-home health visits, a service funded by private donors, and has trained employees how to read a warrant.

"People are not picking up their medicine," Mangia said. "They're not seeing the doctor."

Mangia said that, in the past eight weeks, federal agents have attempted to gain access to patients at a St. John's mobile clinic in Downey and pointed a gun at an employee during a raid at MacArthur Park. Last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors sat in a Southern California hospital waiting for a patient and federal prosecutors charged two health center workers they say interfered with immigration officers' attempts to arrest someone at an Ontario facility.

C.S., an immigrant from Huntington Park without legal status, said she signed up for St. John's home visit services in July because she fears going outside. The 71-year-old woman, who asked to be identified only by her initials for fear of deportation, said she has missed blood work and other lab tests this year. Too afraid to take the bus, she skipped a recent appointment with a specialist for her arthritic hands. She is also prediabetic and struggles with leg pain after a car hit her a few years ago.

"I feel so worried because if I don't get the care I need, it can get much worse," she said in Spanish, speaking about her health issues through an interpreter. A doctor at the clinic gave her a number to call in case she wants to schedule an appointment by phone.

Officials at the federal Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions from KFF Health News seeking comment about the impact of the raids on patients.

There's no indication the Trump administration intends to shift its strategy. Federal officials have sought to pause a judge's order temporarily restricting how they conduct raids in Southern California after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit accusing ICE of deploying unconstitutional tactics. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1 denied the request, leaving the restraining order in place.

In July, Los Angeles County supervisors directed county agencies to explore expanding virtual appointment options after the county's director of health services noted a "huge increase" in phone and video visits. Meanwhile, state lawmakers in California are considering legislation that would restrict immigration agents' access to places such as schools and health care facilities -- Colorado's governor, Democrat Jared Polis, signed a similar bill into law in May.

Immigrants and their families will likely end up using more costly care in emergency rooms as a last resort. And recently passed cuts to Medicaid are expected to further stress ERs and hospitals, said Nicole Lamoureux, president of the National Association of Free & Charitable Clinics.

"Not only are clinics trying to reach people who are retreating from care before they end up with more severe conditions, but the health care safety net is going to be strained due to an influx in patient demand," Lamoureux said.

Mitesh Popat, CEO of Venice Family Clinic, nearly 90% of whose patients are at or below the federal poverty line, said staff call patients before appointments to ask if they plan to come in person and to offer telehealth as an option if they are nervous. They also call if a patient doesn't show five minutes into their appointment and offer immediate telehealth service as an alternative. The clinic has seen a roughly 5% rise in telehealth visits over the past month, Popat said.

In the Salinas Valley, an area with a large concentration of Spanish-speaking farmworkers, Clinica de Salud del Valle de Salinas began promoting telehealth services with Spanish radio ads in January. The clinics also trained people how to use Zoom and other digital platforms at health fairs and community meetings.

CalOptima Health, which covers nearly 1 in 3 residents of Orange County and is the biggest Medi-Cal benefits administrator in the area, sent more than a quarter-million text messages to patients in July encouraging them to use telehealth rather than forgo care, said Chief Executive Officer Michael Hunn. The insurer has also set up a webpage of resources for patients seeking care by phone or home delivery of medication.

"The Latino community is facing a fear pandemic. They're quarantining just the way we all had to during the COVID-19 pandemic," said Seciah Aquino, executive director of the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California, an advocacy group that promotes health access for immigrants and Latinos.

But substituting telehealth isn't a long-term solution, said Isabel Becerra, chief executive officer of the Coalition of Orange County Community Health Centers, whose members reported increases in telehealth visits as high as 40% in the past month.

"As a stopgap, it's very effective," said Becerra, whose group represents 20 clinics in Southern California. "Telehealth can only take you so far. What about when you need lab work? You can't look at a cavity through a screen."

Telehealth also brings a host of other challenges, including technical hiccups with translation services and limited computer proficiency or internet access among patients, she said.

And it's not just immigrants living in the country unlawfully who are scared to seek out care. In southeast Los Angeles County, V.M., a 59-year-old naturalized citizen, relies on her roommate to pick up her groceries and prescriptions. She asked that only her initials be used to share her story and those of her family and friends out of fear they could be targeted.

When she does venture out -- to church or for her monthly appointment at a rheumatology clinic -- she carries her passport and looks askance at any cars with tinted windows.

"I feel paranoid," said V.M., who came to the U.S. more than 40 years ago and is a patient of Venice Family Clinic. "Sometimes I feel scared. Sometimes I feel angry. Sometimes I feel sad."

She now sees her therapist virtually for her depression, which began 10 years ago when rheumatoid arthritis forced her to stop working. She worries about her older brother, who has high blood pressure and has stopped going to the doctor, and about a friend from the rheumatology clinic, who ices swollen hands and feet because she's missed four months of appointments in a row.

"Somebody has to wake up or people are going to start falling apart outside on the streets and they're going to die," she said.

1. Ukraine and allies left scrambling as Trump shifts toward Putin after Alaska summit

LONDON -- Ukraine and its allies were scrambling Sunday to respond to President Donald Trump's apparent shift toward Vladimir Putin's hardline position after their summit in Alaska.

European leaders announced that they would join Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday as they seek to navigate America's new approach to ending the war.

Trump signaled Saturday that he was reversing his insistence on a ceasefire and instead pursuing a permanent peace deal -- aligning the United States with the Kremlin rather than Kyiv and its European backers.

As Ukraine and Europe work out how best to move forward, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von de Leyen, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that they would be joining Zelenskyy, perhaps hoping to ensure there is no repeat of his last Oval Office meeting.

"The trip will serve as an exchange of information" with Trump, Merz' office said. "The talks will address, among other things, security guarantees, territorial issues, and continued support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression."

The news came ahead of a virtual meeting of the so-called "coalition of the willing," which includes more than 30 countries working together to support Ukraine.

While Trump's reversal on pursuing a ceasefire before fuller peace talks fueled alarm on the continent, he did appear to have taken a step toward another position more aligned with the wishes of Ukraine and Europe.

Trump directly engaged with Zelenskyy and European leaders by phone early Saturday morning about the U.S. taking part in a potential NATO-like security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a deal with Russia, two senior administration officials and three sources familiar with the discussions told NBC News.

"European and American security guarantees were discussed," one source familiar with the discussions said. "U.S. troops on the ground was not discussed or entertained by [Trump]."

The security guarantees would be made in the scenario that Russia were to invade Ukraine, again, after a would-be peace deal, the sources said. The sources said that those protections, as discussed by the White House, would not include NATO membership -- despite European leaders saying in a joint statement Saturday that Ukraine should be given the right to seek NATO membership.

But it was clear that the summit had left Ukraine feeling uneasy.

Zelenskyy warned that the Russian leader was complicating efforts to end the war by refusing to halt the brutal fighting before holding further talks.

"Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing. This complicates the situation," Zelenskyy said in a post on X late Saturday.

For civilians on the ground, still under Russian attack even as the diplomatic maneuvering played out, it was not just the substance but the optics of the Alaska talks that caused frustration.

"I was hoping that the U.S. wouldn't roll out the red carpet to the enemy," Kyiv resident Natalya Lypei said Saturday. "How can you welcome a tyrant like this?"


2. Trump-Putin Summit: What We Know

Here are the outcomes of a summit meeting on Ukraine between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, based on statements from Saturday:

- No ceasefire -

Ukraine and European leaders had urged Trump to push for an immediate ceasefire, but this was not agreed to at the summit.

Trump said it was determined by all that the best way to end the "horrific war... is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up".

This stance appears to be a victory for Putin, whose army has made recent progress in eastern Ukraine and who has called for a peace deal that would address what he says are the "root causes" of the conflict, notably the prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine.

According to Kyiv, Russian forces launched 85 drones and one missile at Ukraine overnight Friday to Saturday -- including during the meeting -- while Russia claimed to have taken two more villages in the east of Ukraine.

- No 'severe consequences' -

Ahead of the summit, Trump had threatened "severe consequences" if Putin failed to agree to a ceasefire.

Trump could impose tariffs of up to 500 percent on any country that helps Russia's war effort as part of so-called "secondary sanctions", according to Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham.

But when asked about this by Fox News after the talks, Trump said that, "because of what happened today, I think I don't have to think about that now".

European leaders, meanwhile, said they would keep pressuring Russia, including with further sanctions, until "there is a just and lasting peace".

- Nothing on land concessions -

Ukraine's biggest fear ahead of the Alaska summit was that the United States would push it to give up territories currently occupied by Russia, which comprise around 20 percent of its land, including Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.

Trump expressed support during a call with Zelensky and European leaders after the summit for a proposal by Putin to take full control of two largely Russian-held Ukrainian regions in exchange for freezing the frontline in two others, an official briefed on the talks told AFP.

Putin "de facto demands that Ukraine leave Donbas," an area consisting of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine, the source said.

In exchange, Russian forces would halt their offensive in the Black Sea port region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, where the main cities are still under Ukrainian control.

- Security guarantees -

Guarantees to secure any future peace deal were not mentioned in the Trump-Putin final declaration.

But Trump told Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders that a NATO-style guarantee for Kyiv could be on the table, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and a diplomatic source said -- but without actual NATO membership for Ukraine.

France, Britain and others said they could contribute troops as peace deal guarantors in Ukraine, but not on the frontline.

- Possible three-way meeting -

Trump said he would meet Zelensky in Washington on Monday, and said three-way talks between himself, Putin and Zelensky could be scheduled later.

He had said earlier that a deal to end the war depended on Zelensky alone.

But Zelensky said that Russia refusing to accept a ceasefire "complicates the situation", and questioned its willingness to achieve a lasting peace.


3. Is e-Visa available for US citizens? - Curious Expeditions

Q12: What should I do if I have further questions about a specific country's e-Visa requirements?

Yes, e-Visas are available for US citizens for travel to a wide array of countries. However, the specific countries offering e-Visas, the requirements, and the permitted activities vary significantly.

The concept of an e-Visa (electronic visa) has revolutionized international travel, offering a streamlined and often faster alternative to traditional visa applications. For US citizens, accustomed to relatively easy access to many countries, understanding the nuances of e-Visa eligibility, application processes, and restrictions is crucial for smooth and hassle-free travel. This article provides a comprehensive overview, equipping US travelers with the knowledge to navigate the e-Visa landscape with confidence.

An e-Visa is essentially an authorization to travel issued electronically by a foreign government. Unlike traditional visas affixed to passport pages, an e-Visa is linked electronically to the traveler's passport details in the issuing country's immigration system. This means travelers don't need to physically mail their passport to an embassy or consulate. The process typically involves completing an online application, uploading required documents (such as a passport scan and photograph), and paying a fee. Upon approval, the e-Visa is sent to the traveler's email, and a printed copy is often recommended for presentation at immigration.

Many popular destinations offer e-Visas to US citizens. These include (but are not limited to):

It's crucial to verify the most up-to-date information on the official website of the specific country's immigration department or embassy before applying, as policies can change frequently.

While convenient, e-Visas often come with limitations. These can include:

Failure to adhere to these limitations can result in fines, detention, or even deportation.

The most reliable method is to visit the official website of the country's embassy, consulate, or immigration department. These websites will provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on visa requirements, including whether an e-Visa is available for US passport holders. You can also use the US Department of State's website as a starting point for travel advisories and visa information.

Processing times vary considerably. Some e-Visas are processed within 24-72 hours, while others can take several weeks. It is advisable to apply well in advance of your intended travel dates to avoid any last-minute stress. Always check the estimated processing time on the official application website.

Whether or not you can extend your e-Visa depends on the specific rules of the issuing country. Extending an e-Visa is often not possible, and you may be required to leave the country and apply for a new visa. Check the terms and conditions of your e-Visa or contact the local immigration authorities for clarification.

If your e-Visa application is denied, the issuing country is usually not obligated to provide a reason. However, common reasons for denial include incomplete or inaccurate information on the application, discrepancies between the information provided and passport details, or a perceived risk to national security. You may be able to apply for a traditional visa through the embassy or consulate, providing additional documentation to address any concerns.

No, an e-Visa is not a guarantee of entry. Immigration officials at the port of entry have the final authority to decide whether to allow you into the country. They may ask you questions about your travel purpose, review your documents, and assess whether you meet all entry requirements. Always be prepared to answer questions honestly and respectfully.

Losing your passport while abroad is a serious situation. You should immediately report the loss or theft to the local police and the nearest US embassy or consulate. The embassy or consulate can issue you an emergency passport, which you will then need to present to the local immigration authorities. Depending on the country, you may need to apply for a new e-Visa or a replacement visa.

Yes, unfortunately, there are numerous scam websites that mimic official government websites and charge exorbitant fees for e-Visas. Always apply for an e-Visa through the official government website of the country you plan to visit. Be wary of websites that are not secure (look for "https" in the address bar) or that charge significantly higher fees than expected. Check the official embassy website for validated links.

Yes, children, including infants, generally require their own e-Visas to travel to countries that require visas for US citizens. The application process is usually similar to that for adults, but you will need to provide the child's passport details and a photograph.

Whether you can use an e-Visa for transit depends on the country's transit visa policy. Some countries may require a separate transit visa, even if you do not plan to leave the airport. Always check the specific transit visa requirements of the country you will be transiting through.

While both are electronic travel documents, an ETA is generally simpler and faster to obtain than an e-Visa. An ETA is typically linked to your passport electronically and allows you to travel to a country for a limited purpose, such as tourism or business, without requiring a full visa application. Australia and Canada are two examples of countries using ETAs. An e-Visa typically involves a more detailed application process and may require supporting documents.

If you have any further questions about a specific country's e-Visa requirements, the best course of action is to contact the embassy or consulate of that country in the United States. You can also consult the official website of the country's immigration department. Remember to always rely on official sources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.


4. Lawyer 'very confident' a foreign adversary attacked Canadian diplomats in Cuba

OTTAWA -- A lawyer for Canadian diplomats and their families says he believes the mysterious ailments they suffered in Cuba were caused by a foreign adversary, despite a federal government report that dismisses the theory.

Eight years after foreign service officials and their dependants began reporting such symptoms as headaches, memory loss, mood changes, vision problems, nausea and nosebleeds, a legal action against Ottawa over the health problems is still grinding along in Federal Court.

The 17 plaintiffs, who seek millions of dollars in damages, allege the Canadian government failed to protect them, hid crucial information and downplayed the seriousness of the risks. The government has denied negligence and wrongdoing.

Several U.S. personnel who worked in Cuba have reported similar health issues, commonly known as Havana Syndrome. Theories about the cause have included pesticide spraying, the effect of chirping crickets, malfunctioning eavesdropping devices, and targeted energy or sonic attacks by an enemy state.

The Canadian government says it has found no evidence of foul play by a foreign adversary.

A Global Affairs Canada report completed in August 2024 says the department has concluded that the unexplained health incidents "were not the result of a malicious act of a foreign actor."

The report, drawing on the work of an interdepartmental task force and external experts, says pre-existing medical conditions, environmental factors and conventional illnesses "were likely to have been important factors in many of the symptoms experienced."

The report adds that the findings "do not cast doubt on the authenticity of the symptoms reported by staff members and their dependants."

Paul Miller, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told The Canadian Press he is "very confident" a foreign actor is to blame for the Canadians' health difficulties.

"I really trust the people that I have spoken with and met with," he said.

"I have absolutely no faith in the (Global Affairs Canada) report because they are trying to put out the narrative that works for them."

The plaintiffs' court action, filed in 2019, remains unresolved.

Three years ago, the parties agreed to the appointment of a former Supreme Court judge to mediate the claims of nine family members in the case.

Miller said the two days of talks in early 2023 "just went nowhere."

He said he has made efforts to file new information in the case but the material is being treated as confidential pending the resolution of concerns about the disclosure of sensitive or potentially injurious information, as defined by the Canada Evidence Act.

The Global Affairs report traces the various steps federal agencies have taken over the years in response to the illness complaints, including security, medical and environmental assessments.

A multi-agency Integrated National Security Enforcement Team, led by the RCMP, opened an investigation in June 2017.

Global Affairs and RCMP officials began travelling regularly to Cuba as part of the investigation to look at the possibility of malicious attacks, the report says. Canadian officials also shared information with foreign partners, including the United States.

In 2019, instruments designed to detect and capture evidence of acoustic and radiation surges, and to measure environmental effects -- such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and ozone levels -- were installed in the living quarters of Canadian staff in Havana.

"The data collected from the instruments did not provide relevant and probative information to identify a cause for the symptoms," the Global Affairs report says. "As such, in 2022, the instruments were removed."

The integrated national security team concluded "there was no criminality and no evidence attributing these health symptoms to a foreign actor," the report adds.

"In their conclusions, the RCMP and other domestic partner agencies assess that there is no known criminality, no known attribution for (unexplained health incidents) and no patterns related to symptoms, age, gender, location, or other variable."

The U.S. intelligence community looked at possible evidence of a foreign adversary's involvement, the feasibility of tools that could cause the reported symptoms and whether medical analysis could help find answers.

A March 1, 2023, report from the U.S. National Intelligence Council said these lines of inquiry led most intelligence community agencies to conclude -- with varying levels of confidence -- that it was "very unlikely" a foreign adversary was responsible for the health issues reported by American personnel.

Global Affairs, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the RCMP subsequently met to discuss the U.S. council's findings.

The RCMP indicated that "since no criminality was uncovered, its criminal investigation would be concluded," and CSIS advised it also would be wrapping up its investigations for similar reasons, the Global Affairs report says.

Overall, the Canadian efforts "have not uncovered a clear common cause of the symptoms experienced by government of Canada employees," the report adds. "Canada's findings are aligned with the conclusions of the United States on their various health studies and the security report published by the National Intelligence Council."

Miller points to other research and testimony that challenge those findings.

Lawyer Mark Zaid, representing several U.S. personnel with symptoms, told a congressional hearing in May 2024 there was intelligence, scientific and medical evidence substantiating the reports of anomalous health incidents, and that some were caused by a foreign adversary.

Zaid, who had authorized access to secret details, said he was convinced that "the evidence that exists in the classified arena directly contradicts the public conclusions" provided by U.S. federal agencies about the cause of the health symptoms.

Global Affairs says it stands by the findings of its 2024 report.

Department spokesperson John Babcock said the foreign ministry continues to support the Canadian diplomats and their dependants.

"For privacy and security reasons, Global Affairs Canada cannot comment on the specifics of the ongoing investigations, individual cases, nor on specific security measures," he said in an emailed response to questions.

"We cannot provide further comment on this matter as it is before the courts."

Internal Global Affairs notes -- prepared last year to help answer questions about the department's report -- say the unexplained health incidents "highlighted the challenges of providing responsive health care to diplomats and their families in the context of unforeseen crisis situations abroad."

The notes, obtained through the Access to Information Act, say the department had initiated a "thorough review" of the department's overseas health program for employees and their dependants in missions around the world.

5. The US May Have Already Lost the AI Race to China Due to a Key Weakness

You might have heard of an "AI race" heating up between the US and China, a bitter rivalry between two global adversaries that could shape the direction of world history.

At least, that's how some in the US feel. While China has repeatedly tried to establish a geopolitical friendship with the richest nation in the world, officials and pundits in the US have doubled down, reframing artificial intelligence as the 21st century's nuclear bomb.

In the meantime, China may have gotten a massive lead -- by actively investing in its power grid, while the United States' is quickly running out of capacity to power immensely power-hungry AI models.

As Fortune reports, Americans who've had a look at China's technological development firsthand found that the two country's aren't even in the same league, given China's next-level power grid.

"Energy is considered a solved problem," wrote Rui Ma, editor of the US publication Tech Buzz China.

"Everywhere we went, people treated energy availability as a given," she continued. "This is a stark contrast to the US, where AI growth is increasingly tied to debates over data center power consumption and grid limitations."

AI is a notoriously energy-intensive technology. The data centers powering large language models like ChatGPT are immense labyrinths of computer chips, which suck down resources like power and water in order to keep up with demand.

As Fortune notes, this effectively makes electricity the key bottleneck for expanding AI infrastructure.

That's caused some critical shortages in the US. Short on energy and hopped up on fantasies of an arms race, American companies are resorting to all kinds of bizarre strategies to get their juice. Elon Musk's xAI, for example, is running 35 portable methane gas generators in the parking lot of one of its main datacenters in Memphis, encircling nearby communities in a cloud of noxious smog.

China has no such problems. In 2024, China was responsible for nearly 65 percent of the world's renewable energy construction, installing so many solar panels and wind turbines that it caused the country's CO2 emissions to drop for the first time -- despite record-high demands for energy.

Whether or not the US can catch up remains to be seen. President Donald Trump previously made an off-the-cuff remark about attaching coal power plants to data centers directly.

It's an unfortunate conundrum in an age when energy demand in the US has never been higher. In the meantime, China keeps chugging along, seemingly unperturbed by any energy bottlenecks -- and the Trump administration's posturing.


6. Economists expect tariffs lifted food prices, core inflation in July

OTTAWA -- Tariff impacts are expected to keep underlying inflation elevated in July, a Desjardins economist says, even if the headline figure retreats.

Statistics Canada is set to report inflation figures for July on Tuesday. A poll of economists expects annual inflation cooled last month to 1.7 per cent, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.

June's consumer price index showed the annual rate of inflation ticked up to 1.9 per cent.

Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins, said he expects the headline inflation figure slowed beyond expectations to 1.6 per cent in July as lower energy costs continue to take steam out of price pressures.

"We're kind of expecting it to be a bit softer than what we saw back in June. So, from a headline perspective anyway, that's overall pretty positive news for Canadians," he said in an interview.

RBC is above the economists' consensus, expecting July's annual inflation reading will match the 1.9 per cent seen in June.

Economists Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan wrote in a note to clients Friday that the removal of the consumer carbon price at the start of April "continues to artificially lower headline inflation."

But they warned that price pressures below the surface should remain stubborn in July.

"Underlying trends have surprised upward this year, partly due to tariff impacts on products like food and vehicles, but also from higher prices for domestic services," Janzen and Fan wrote.

The Bank of Canada's preferred metrics of core inflation floated a bit above three per cent in June, according to Statistics Canada.

Bartlett said Desjardins foresees these metrics holding between 2.5 per cent and three per cent for the rest of the year as Canada's tariff dispute with the United States drives up prices.

He said he'll be looking to see whether more businesses were passing costs from tariffs onto consumers in July.

Consumer price index data from the United States this past week appeared to show a tariff impact in the form of higher prices for shoes and furniture.

While he believes the bulk of tariff price impacts were passed through in April and May, Bartlett said Canada will continue to feel the pinch from border levies on food and durable goods.

"That's going to put persistent upward pressure on price growth in Canada," he said.

The Bank of Canada held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.75 per cent on July 30 as it waits for more information on how the Canada-U.S. trade dispute is affecting the economy.

The summary of deliberations from that decision released this past week show the central bank's governing council remains wary of the effect of tariffs on inflation.

Members indicated in those minutes that the impact on consumer prices "appeared to be modest so far," but the tariff influence is only just starting to show up in the data.

While businesses' inflation expectations remain well-anchored according to recent surveys, the governing council said the costs of finding new suppliers amid shifting global trade could still push prices higher.

"Overall, members agreed that it was still too early to assess how tariffs and the rewiring of trade would affect economic activity and inflation in Canada," the summary read.

Bartlett said he expects economic data will open the door to a quarter-point interest rate cut at the Bank of Canada's next decision on Sept. 17.

But that's contingent on core inflation readings getting back under control in the upcoming CPI releases for July and August.

"If we see that there's less passthrough from tariffs into inflation than we're expecting ... we think there there's an opportunity for the Bank of Canada to cut further," he said.

7. Nutritionists Are So Worried You Aren't Getting These 4 Nutrients, They're Calling It A 'Public Health Concern'

It's gotten so bad that they're officially called "nutrients of public health concern."

If you're eating the way most people in America do these days, you're probably falling short of the vital nutrients you need. Fewer than 10% of us meet the daily recommended intake for vegetables (2 to 3 cups a day), and only 20% of us eat enough fruit (1 1/2 to 2 cups daily). The situation is even worse with what the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services call shortfall nutrients, which are important but underconsumed nutrients.

The current shortfall list includes vitamins A, D, E and C, along with folate, calcium, magnesium, fiber and potassium. For adolescent and premenopausal females, iron is also a shortfall nutrient. Of these, four have been classified as "nutrients of public health concern" because their underconsumption has been linked in scientific literature to adverse health outcomes. Those vital four are fiber, calcium, vitamin D and potassium.

It's a downward trend that concerns nutrition experts. Registered dietitian nutritionist Sharon Palmer said: "Unfortunately, our diets are not as nutrient-rich as we wish they could be, for reasons that include access and affordability of healthful foods and reliance on overly processed foods over minimally processed foods. People aren't cooking as much as they used to, and they're snacking more instead of sitting down to meals. That adds up to more refined foods, and fewer nutrients, on the plate."

The situation, for Palmer, has less to do with the sludge we're currently consuming than with all the important things we aren't eating: "We're missing out on nutritious foods that are so rich in these nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans."

We asked nutrition experts to tell us more about these "public health concern" nutrients -- to find out why they're so important and how to eat enough of them.

Nearly every nutritionist interviewed for this story led off with a plea for us to eat more fiber, right now. They are really serious about this, explaining that it's important for many more reasons than just avoiding constipation.

Registered dietitian Kara Landau said: "Dietary fiber is essential not only for a healthy digestive tract, but it also plays an important role in our metabolic health, such as protection from heart disease and improving blood glucose regulation."

Eating more fiber comes with other benefits, too, said registered dietician nutritionist Chelsey Amer: "When you focus [on] boosting fiber intake, you'll also consume more of other shortfall nutrients, like vitamins A, D, E and C, which are found in fruits and vegetables, or the magnesium and iron found in beans."

Most of us are falling woefully short of fiber goals, said registered dietician Morgan Walker, an adjunct professor at Lebanon Valley College: "The recommended daily intake of fiber is 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men, but most Americans consume fewer than 15 grams per day," she said.

And fiber under-consumption can't just be solved with a morning bowl of Colon Blow, Landau said: "You need to look for diversity, so rather than just selecting one high-fiber bran-based cereal, it's more beneficial to include different high-fiber choices all day long."

We all grew up hearing that calcium would help build strong bones, but now that we're done growing, many of us feel that we don't need it anymore. But this under-appreciated nutrient is of lifelong importance, Landau said. "It's important for ongoing bone and heart health," she said, adding a reminder that vitamins D and K2 enhance its absorption.

Registered dietician nutritionist Lauren Manaker highlighted the benefits of keeping up with calcium, D and K2: "Together, they reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures later in life."

The recommended daily calcium intake is 1,000 milligrams for most adults, increasing to 1,200 milligrams for women over 50 and men over 70. While dairy is a great source of calcium, there are plenty of other options, the experts said. "It's becoming more well-accepted that there are other great sources such as broccoli, leafy greens, chia and basil seeds," Landau said. "A great example of a calcium-rich snack would be Greek yogurt topped with chia seeds and fruit."

The role of vitamin D is continuing to be studied, and it seems as if new benefits emerge all the time. "It's well-known for its role in bone health, but emerging research has also highlighted its broader role in overall health," Walker said, noting that it's been shown to boost immune function and has been linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. "There's also research showing an influence on mental health, with vitamin D deficiencies associated with conditions like depression," she added.

The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 600 international units, or IU, for adults under 70 and 800 IU for adults over 70. Walker noted that many experts believe that higher amounts may be necessary for optimal health. Approximately 35% of adults in the United States have a vitamin D deficiency, research shows.

It's an increasingly common situation, said registered dietician Amy Shapiro, lead nutritionist at ButcherBox. "Almost everyone is deficient in vitamin D, which can be hard to get from food," she said. "Lean into sustainably sourced salmon, grass-fed beef, crate-free pork and mushrooms, and you'll get a good dose. By setting up your plate to be 1/4 lean protein, 1/2 vegetables and 1/4 complex carbohydrates, you can improve your odds of meeting nutrient needs."

If you can't remember the last time you ate a banana or a potato (chips and fries don't count), you might be one of the millions who are falling short of the amount of potassium you need.

"Most people eat less than 2,600 milligrams of potassium per day, which is significantly lower than the recommended 4,700 milligrams," said registered dietician nutritionist Jen Hernandez. One of the reasons it's important to get enough of this nutrient, she said, is because potassium plays an important role in regulating blood pressure. "But the foods richest in potassium -- fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and legumes -- aren't eaten enough as part of the standard American diet," she said.

One reason for this imbalance, said registered dietician nutritionist Cory Mygrant, is the high sodium content in our diets. "Many people consume too much sodium, often due to processed foods, and so they aren't getting enough potassium to balance it out. Potassium is a crucial nutrient that works alongside sodium to help maintain the right balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. This imbalance can lead to high blood pressure, which is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease."

Two top sources of potassium, potatoes and bananas, have been "demonized" in some circles, Hernandez said, but they're great sources of a vital nutrient: "A medium baked potato has 164 calories and 952 milligrams of potassium, and a medium banana has just 105 calories, but 422 milligrams of potassium."

All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it's at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days. But if you're reaching for a bottle of multivitamins right to supplement the gaps, you may want to slow your roll, experts said.

Registered dietician nutritionist Marissa Karp had this advice: "While supplements can help us bridge the gap and serve as an insurance policy, they aren't a replacement for eating nourishing foods. If you aren't already eating well, moving your body, drinking water and managing your stress, don't waste money on supplements. Taking supplements and then eating processed foods is not the same as eating a whole foods diet and using supplements to help ensure you're getting enough."

She offered this example of the joy of whole foods: "When you eat an avocado, it's not just about the potassium or dietary fiber, but the synergy of the nutrients working together. It's how the fat and fiber in the avocado slow down your gastric emptying and help keep you fuller longer. It's also about how satisfying it tastes."

Staying well-nourished is much simpler than you might think, Walker said. "We don't need extreme diets or supplements to fill these nutrient gaps, but simple, intentional dietary shifts that can make a significant impact. By increasing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy and lean proteins, you can improve your intake of these critical shortfall nutrients, leading to better long-term health and disease prevention."


8. Randy Orton, Nikki Bella, Rey Mysterio, and others react to former WWE champion's personal update

Several current and former WWE personalities, including Randy Orton, Nikki Bella, and Rey Mysterio, recently took to social media to react to former United States Champion Logan Paul's personal update. The Maverick took a huge step in his relationship with Nina Agdal.

Logan Paul has been publicly dating Nina Agdal since 2022. The two got engaged on July 9, 2023, and were blessed with a baby girl in September 2024. Paul has now taken a massive step in his relationship with Agdal as the duo recently tied the knot.

Following his marriage ceremony, The Maverick took to Instagram to share photos from the wedding. In his post's caption, Logan sent a wholesome four-word message.

"Mr. and Mrs. Paul," he wrote.

Several current and former WWE personalities reacted with a like on Logan Paul's Instagram post, including Randy Orton, Rey Mysterio, Dominik Mysterio, Liv Morgan, Finn Balor, Kelani Jordan, The Miz, Maxxine Dupri, Megan Morant, Adam Pearce, Cathy Kelley, Maryse, and more.

Meanwhile, Shane Helms (The Hurricane), Nikki Bella, and Drew Gulak left wholesome comments on it.

Check out screenshots of stars' likes and comments below:

Logan Paul and John Cena are all set to face each other in a singles match at the upcoming WWE Clash in Paris Premium Live Event. Ahead of the show, Paul took shots at Cena during a recent edition of his IMPAULSIVE podcast.

The Maverick said that he believed the 17-time World Champion was having a "midlife crisis," highlighting the latter's character changes in 2025. Logan added that he felt Cena was not being true to himself and was trying to please people with the babyface turn.

"But then the switch up back to trying to be a babyface makes me feel like he's seeking outside validation and he's being guided by the audience instead of himself. It feels like to me, we're watching a midlife crisis happen live. I'm serious. I loved John Cena, we had a tag and I got to work with him a little bit and see what he was really like. I wish he would be more like me and just be himself. I'm serious. I think he needs to just like find yourself and stop trying to like please the crowd for your own personal validation," he said.

It will be interesting to see who will come out on top between Logan Paul and John Cena at WWE Clash in Paris.


9. What country has the most fast trains? - Curious Expeditions

Is high-speed rail a viable transportation option for all countries?

China definitively holds the title for the country with the most high-speed rail (HSR) and fast trains. Its extensive network, unparalleled in both length and passenger volume, dwarves those of other nations.

The scale of China's HSR development is truly breathtaking. Within just a few decades, the country has built a network that now exceeds 42,000 kilometers (over 26,000 miles) of operational high-speed rail lines, significantly exceeding the combined total of all other countries. This vast network connects major urban centers, facilitates economic growth, and transforms travel across the country. The trains themselves, often branded as "Fuxing" or "Harmony" trains, are technologically advanced, providing comfortable and efficient transportation at speeds reaching up to 350 kilometers per hour (217 mph) on some lines. The Chinese government has prioritized HSR as a crucial element of its infrastructure development plan, seeing it as a key driver of economic development and improved connectivity.

While China indisputably leads, several other countries boast impressive HSR systems. Japan, a pioneer in high-speed rail with its iconic Shinkansen (bullet train), maintains a technologically advanced and reliable network. Spain has invested heavily in HSR, particularly connecting its major cities. France, with its TGV (Train √† Grande Vitesse), has a well-established network connecting Paris to various regional centers and neighboring countries. Other countries with significant HSR networks include Germany (ICE - Intercity-Express), South Korea (KTX - Korea Train eXpress), and Italy (Frecciarossa). These nations have all recognized the benefits of high-speed rail in terms of reduced travel times, increased efficiency, and environmental sustainability. However, none can rival the sheer scale and ongoing expansion of China's HSR infrastructure.

China's success in rapidly developing its HSR network can be attributed to several key factors:

Generally, a "fast train" refers to a high-speed rail (HSR) train that operates at speeds of 200 km/h (124 mph) or greater on existing lines, or 250 km/h (155 mph) or greater on dedicated high-speed tracks. This definition can vary slightly depending on the country and specific regulations.

Japan was the first country to implement dedicated high-speed rail, with the launch of the Shinkansen (bullet train) in 1964. This groundbreaking innovation revolutionized transportation and paved the way for HSR development in other countries.

HSR offers several advantages, including:

Some of the fastest operating high-speed trains include:

The cost of building a high-speed rail line can vary widely depending on factors such as terrain, population density, land acquisition costs, and the specific technology used. Costs can range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars per kilometer.

While HSR is generally more environmentally friendly than air travel or car travel, it can still have some environmental impacts, including:

HSR can provide numerous social and economic benefits, including:

Building and operating HSR can be challenging due to factors such as:

High-speed rail systems differ across countries in terms of technology, design, operational characteristics, and funding models. Some countries use conventional steel-wheel rail technology, while others use magnetic levitation (maglev) technology. Train designs, speeds, and service frequencies also vary. Funding models can range from fully government-funded to public-private partnerships.

China manages its vast HSR network through a combination of centralized planning, advanced technology, and efficient operational management. China State Railway Group Co., Ltd., a state-owned enterprise, plays a central role in planning, constructing, and operating the HSR network. Sophisticated monitoring and control systems are used to ensure safety and efficiency.

Many countries are planning to expand their HSR networks in the coming years. In Europe, there are plans to expand cross-border connections and improve service frequencies. In the United States, there are proposals for new HSR lines in California, Texas, and the Northeast Corridor. China continues to expand its HSR network, connecting more cities and regions.

The viability of HSR as a transportation option depends on various factors, including population density, economic conditions, geography, and political support. HSR is generally more viable in densely populated areas with strong economies and supportive governments. However, it may not be a feasible option for countries with low population densities, limited financial resources, or challenging terrain. Careful feasibility studies and cost-benefit analyses are essential to determine the viability of HSR projects in specific contexts.


10. Juan Cole: Earth Hottest On Record Again, as CO2 Still Climbs and Glaciers Wilt

Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) - The American Meteorological Society has issued its annual climate report, this one summarizing changes in 2024 now that all the data is in. It paints an alarming picture, especially at a moment when Big Oil has taken over the US government via its Republican puppets and is spiking all our efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to move to green energy. Carbon dioxide is a dangerous greenhouse gas, which keeps the sun's heat from radiating back out into space, and acts like someone set off atomic bombs in the atmosphere. People think nothing of burning gasoline in their cars, or coal and fossil gas for heating or electricity, but would be freaked out if someone detonated atomic bombs in the sky over their homes every day. But it comes to the same thing.

AMS says that the global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to about 422.8 parts per million in 2024, a 52% increase over the level of about 278 ppm that had prevailed in the 18th and previous centuries before the Industrial Revolution.

The last time the atmosphere held this much CO2 was the Pliocene era from 5 to 2 million years ago. Half of Florida was under water and sea level was many feet higher. The seas may not rise as much in our era because we're coming off a cold period. But Louisiana, Washington, D.C., New York City and the whole countries of Egypt and Bangladesh would suffer tremendously even with just a 15 to 20 foot sea level rise.

Really bad news: from 2023 to 2024, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere rose by a whopping 3.4 parts per million. That equals the growth from 2015 to 2016, the highest rate recorded since the 1960s.

Folks, we're supposed to cut additional carbon dioxide emissions to zero, not increase them by record amounts.

The average surface temperature of the earth for last year was the hottest ever on record going back to 1850, which probably means the hottest since about 122,000 years ago before recent episodes of ice age.

That's hot.

Some of the extra heat was owing to the El Ni√±o in the first half of the year, but El Ni√±os are cyclical, occurring every few years because of shifting wind and current patterns in Pacific, and you don't get ever increasing heat records only because of a cyclical phenomenon. The secular increase is because of the significant augments in CO2. Many new record temperatures were set. The AMS says these temperature highs were reported by those countries that are keeping records. The United States under Trump may fall out of that category, though many individual American states will likely go on keeping their own records.

Entire glaciers definitively died off, including all the ones in Venezuela and the Conejeres in Colombia. Those that survive were put on a diet by the heat; the authors say, "Glaciers lost a record amount of their mass in 2024; all 58 reference glaciers across the globe reported loss." The earth is a big place and regional climate varies, so it is unusual that all 58 reference glaciers should shrink in concert. It only ever happened once before, in 2023. Things are getting worse.

The oceans used to be cool, but they are rapidly heating up, too. Last year's average sea surface temperature was hotter than at any time since records began being kept 171 years ago. Heatwaves struck almost everywhere in the oceans, sparing only 9% of their surface.

Global heating and climate breakdown cause hurricanes to be more intense and to drop more water when they make landfall. While there were not more hurricanes than usual in the past two years, the ones we had were doozies. Yagi in the Pacific rose to the level of super typhoon and devastated Vietnam and China, killing 800 people. Hurricane Helene blew down trees and houses from Florida up into the Appalachians and flooded out the latter, killing 200 people. Not since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005 had a storm taken that many American lives. Then Milton hit Florida again, only 12 days later.

More heat leads to more evaporation of water and more moisture in the atmosphere, which leads to more rain and more flooding. You'd think the least likely place for the international airport to be shut down by heavy rainfall and flooding would be Dubai, not far from the Arabian Empty Quarter desert. But that's what happened last year.

A sudden downpour in Valencia in Spain killed over 200 people and did extensive damage, and got the mayor and even the central government in trouble. The prime minister and his cabinet were just cleared in late July of criminal negligence. Locals had charged that they didn't send the necessary warnings from Madrid to Valencia in time to save all those lives, but the high court could find no evidence for any negligence. Ironically, the socialist government of Pedro Sanchez has been the best on green energy in Spain's modern history. But the episode suggests to me that as climate disasters get worse and more frequent, politicians like those in the US Republican Party who are seen by the public as responsible will increasingly face risks from angry constituents. Of course, Spain's public may be less misinformed than those of the backward US, which suffers from media monopolies like that of Rupert Murdoch that deliberately falsify the news about issues like climate change. Abraham Lincoln, though, pointed out that you can't fool all the people all the time.

Foreign portfolio investors offloaded Indian equity holdings by approximately Rs 21,000 crore in early August 2025, driven by US-India trade disputes, muted Q1 corporate results, and rupee depreciation.The total FPI equity outflows reached Rs 1.16 lakh crore in 2025, as per depository records. Meanwhile, depository data also show that FPIs withdrew Rs 20,975 crore from equities through August 14. This follows July's Rs 17,741 crore withdrawal, which contrasts with the Rs 38,673 crore investment during March to June.The reduced US-Russia tensions and absence of new sanctions indicate that the proposed 25 per cent secondary tariff on India might not be implemented after August 27, benefiting markets, according to Vaqarjaved Khan, CFA - Senior Fundamental Analyst, Angel One, as quoted by PTI.S&P's upgrade of India's credit rating from BBB- to BBB could positively influence FPI outlook, he further noted."The sustained outflows are being driven primarily by a confluence of global uncertainties. Heightened geopolitical tensions and ambiguity surrounding the interest rate trajectory in developed economies, particularly the United States, have contributed to a risk-averse sentiment," stated Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director - Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India.The strengthening US dollar has reduced emerging market investments' appeal, including India's, he explained.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments, attributed the outflows to modest earnings growth and high valuations.Continuous selling affected IT sector performance, while banking and financial sectors remained stable due to reasonable valuations and institutional investment.Conversely, FPIs invested Rs 4,469 crore in debt general limits and Rs 232 crore through the voluntary retention route during this period.

5. [Finlight] ‚ÄòStunning survival story‚Äô: Police rescue California man trapped behind waterfall for two days

A California man who recently became trapped behind a waterfall for two days while climbing was dramatically rescued by police utilizing a helicopter.

Ryan Wardwell, 46, of Long Beach, went to waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups on 10 August with plans to rappel down, the sheriff‚Äôs office of Tulare country said in a social media post. But the ‚Äúextreme hydraulics‚Äù of the waterfalls pushed Wardwell off his rappelling lines and trapped him behind a cascade of the Kern river, according to the sheriff‚Äôs office.

His failure to return to his car that night prompted local law enforcement to spend 11 August searching for him with infrared technology and aircraft. Difficult terrain and fading daylight thwarted their efforts that day. But rescuers found Wardwell the next day after flying a drone behind the cascade in question.

Wardwell was alive and conscious when rescuers spotted him, and he told them how he had become stranded there, the Tulare county sheriff‚Äôs office said. A California highway patrol helicopter crew then managed to hoist him to safety to cap off what the sheriff‚Äôs office declared a ‚Äústunning survival story‚Äù.

Wardwell received treatment for dehydration and ‚Äúonly minor injuries‚Äù, and he was reunited with family who had gone to the scene, the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

The agency published video of Wardwell‚Äôs rescue on Facebook, where it captured attention from news media outlets that reported on the situation. The clip showed the helicopter whipping around foliage and water around the cascade before the crew lifted Wardwell onboard.

An attraction for hiking and outdoors adventure enthusiasts, the Seven Teacups are in a secluded area about two hours south of the Sequoia national park, which itself is east of Visalia, California.

Wardwell had rappelled the falls several times before, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. On his 10 August trip there, friends had accompanied him, though they opted to stop going further after seeing the rushing water‚Äôs power, California highway patrol flight officer paramedic Mike Crane said to the Chronicle.

According to the outlet, Wardwell‚Äôs friends left a note on his car telling passersby to report him missing if the vehicle was still there the next day, which it was.

Wardwell ended up nestling himself in a dark cave beneath the waterfall ‚Äì completely soaked ‚Äì after being thrusted off his rappel lines, the Chronicle added.

Tulare county sheriff‚Äôs office captain Kevin Kemmerling told the Chronicle that Wardwell fought to escape for two days, ‚Äúbut there was nothing he could do to break through‚Äù.

‚ÄúThere was no way for him to warm up or dry out in there, so it had to have been miserable,‚Äù Kemmerling said to the newspaper.

Crane, speaking to the Chronicle, added: ‚ÄúI got the impression that maybe he didn‚Äôt know if he was ever going to get out of there.‚Äù

The Tulare sheriff‚Äôs office said in its statement that it reminded members of the public ‚Äúto always be aware of their environment and capabilities, especially when navigating white water rivers‚Äù like the one at the Seven Teacups.

‚ÄúStay safe, stay smart and stay alive,‚Äù the statement from the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

7. [Finlight] Pakistan floods: More than 200 missing in one district, official says

More than 200 missing in flood-hit district in Pakistan, official says

Rescue teams have buried eight unidentified bodies as there were no family members found alive to claim them, said Jehangir Khan, spokesman for the deputy commissioner office of Buner.

A local official in the worst-affected Buner district told the BBC that at least 209 people were still missing there, but it is feared that number could rise.

Flash floods have killed more than 300 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in recent days, with most of the deaths recorded in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

More than 200 people remain missing in one district of north-west Pakistan as a result of devastating monsoon flooding and landslides, an official has said.

Some relatives are also unable to claim their relatives bodies' as roads are severely damaged, he added.

A provincial rescue spokesman told news agency AFP that "10 to 12 entire villages" were partially buried.

Asfandyar Khattak, head of the provincial disaster management authority, said "dozens" of people were missing in Shangla district.

Monsoon rains between June and September deliver about three-quarters of South Asia's annual rainfall.

While landslides and flash floods are common as a result, scientists say that climate change is making these weather events more intense and more frequent.

Torrential rain has also hit Indian-administered Kashmir, days after at least 60 people were killed there by flash floods.

Nine were killed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir this week, while another five died in the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, authorities said.

Government forecasters say heavy rainfall is expected until 21 August in the north-west, where several areas have been declared disaster zones.

Pakistan has been reckoning with the devastation of this year's monsoon season since June. At least 650 people have been killed so far this year.

In July, Punjab, home to nearly half of Pakistan's 255 million people, recorded 73% more rainfall than the prior year and more deaths than in the entire previous monsoon season.

Northern Pakistan is also one of the most glaciated areas in the region, but these are rapidly thinning and retreating because of climate change - meaning rocks, soil, and other debris can be dislodged.

Monsoon rains can further destabilise mountain faces, exacerbating landslides that sometimes block rivers.

While the exact cause of the recent floods and landslides are yet to be determined, glaciologists say that ice melt is a contributing factor.

TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) ‚Äî Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian government intervened and forced the airline and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration.

The strike stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season.

The country's largest airline said in a release that the first flights will resume Sunday evening but that it will take several days before its operations return to normal. It said some flights will be canceled over the next seven to 10 days until the schedule is stabilized.

Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. Hajdu referred the work stoppage to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.

The airline said Sunday the Canada Industrial Relations Board has extended the term of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.

The shutdown of Canada‚Äôs largest airline early Saturday was impacting about 130,000 people a day. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.

According to numbers from aviation analytics provider Cirium, Air Canada had canceled a total of 671 flights by Saturday afternoon ‚Äî following 199 on Friday. And another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.

The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada‚Äôs prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.

Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.

Last year, the government forced the country‚Äôs two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union‚Äôs leverage in negotiations.

The Business Council of Canada had urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too. And the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed the intervention.

Hajdu maintained that her Liberal government is not anti-union, saying it is clear the two sides are at an impasse.

Passengers whose flights are impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline‚Äôs website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.

The airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full ‚Äúdue to the summer travel peak.‚Äù

Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal.

Both sides have said they remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work flight attendants do when planes aren‚Äôt in the air.

The airline‚Äôs latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said ‚Äúwould have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.‚Äù

But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn‚Äôt go far enough because of inflation.

1. Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems - SiliconANGLE

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for overseas market.

Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba.

As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in global trade landscape.

At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world."

China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce.

Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.


8. China's AI tech boosts global trade efficiency, facilitates supply chain

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q&A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing.

"Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

During discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade.

Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model.

"The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes.

At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms.
