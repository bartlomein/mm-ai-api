1. Zelensky claims Russia 'complicating' ceasefire efforts as PM meets allies

Russia is complicating efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to meet with European leaders to discuss the war.

The coalition of the willing, the alliance which is planning to police a future peace deal in Ukraine, will meet on Sunday afternoon amid reports Donald Trump favours a Russian land grab to end the war.

Following the Alaska summit between Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin on Friday, the American leader suggested he wants to move straight to a full peace deal, rather than negotiating a ceasefire first.

The shift in Mr Trump's position appears to echo the Russians' refusal to agree to ceasefire before engaging in peace talks.

Several news outlets have cited sources which claimed that during the negotiations Mr Putin demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops.

Other outlets reported that Mr Trump is inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelensky about it when they meet in the Oval Office.

Writing on social media on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian leader railed against Russia's refusal to lay down arms temporarily before agreeing to end the war.

Mr Zelensky said: "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing.

"This complicates the situation."

He added: "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades.

"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war."

The Prime Minister, alongside French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz, will host the coalition of the willing on Sunday afternoon.

The video conference will see allies who plan to keep the peace in Ukraine gather ahead of Mr Zelensky's visit to Washington on Monday.

The Ukrainian leader is expected to attend the Sunday afternoon video call, which is scheduled to take place at 2pm UK time.

Friday's summit between Mr Trump and Mr Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, ended without any commitment towards a ceasefire.

The Russian president described it as "timely" and "useful" after he left.

Mr Trump afterwards suggested it was time for Mr Zelensky to make a deal to end the war.

Sir Keir commended Mr Trump's "pursuit of an end to the killing", but insisted Ukraine's leader must not be excluded from future talks to broker a peace in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister and European leaders appeared increasingly confident that Mr Trump will offer a "security guarantee" of air support to back up allied troops on the ground in Ukraine, should they be deployed to keep the peace.

Experts have warned the face-to-face summit has risked legitimising the Russian leader, who has been made a pariah by the international community for invading Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky has warned Russia may ramp up its strikes against his country in the coming days "in order to create more favourable political circumstances for talks with global actors".


2. "Those who dance with Constitution... trampled it:" PM Modi lashes out at Congress for "betraying" Ambedkar, cites dangerous 'safai' law

New Delhi [India], August 17 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday alleged that those who dance with the Constitution on their heads had trampled the Constitution and betraying the sentiments of BR Ambedkar by retaining oppressive laws for decades before he came and started repealing them.

Addressing a government event to inaugurate two national highway projects in Delhi, the Prime Minister said that previous governments had treated safai karamcharis like slaves. I am telling you the truth of how those who dance with the Constitution on their heads trampled the Constitution and betrayed Babasaheb Ambedkar. You will be shocked, PM Modi said.

The Prime Minister raised questions on the Opposition claims of working for social justice and alleged that Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, had a provision of sending sanitation workers to jail for a month if they did not show up for work without prior information.

Today I am going to tell you that truth. In Delhi, there was a dangerous law in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. There was a clause that if a safai mitra (sanitation worker) skipped work without informing beforehand, he or she could be jailed for a month. Think about it, what did they think of safai karmacharis? You will put them in jail for a small mistake? They now talk big about social justice. They made and kept such laws. It is Modi who is removing these laws and repealing them, the Prime Minister said.

It is Modi who is tirelessly finding and abolishing such unjust laws and this campaign continues relentlessly, he added.

Lashing out at the previous Congress government in Haryana, PM Modi alleged that every job appointment was influenced from corruption in the state.

There was a time in Haryana, during the Congress governments, when it was difficult to get even a single appointment without spending money or using influence. But in Haryana, the BJP government has given lakhs of youth government jobs with complete transparency. Under the leadership of Nayab Singh Saini ji, this process is continuing...

Additionally, PM Modi said that to make India stronger we must take inspiration from Lord Krishna and to make India self-reliant, we must follow the path of Mahatma Gandhi. The country celebrated the festival of Janmashtami yesterday.

To make India stronger, we must take inspiration from Chakradhari Mohan (Shri Krishna). To make India self-reliant, we must follow the path of Charkhadhari Mohan (Mahatma Gandhi). We need to make Vocal for Local mantra of our life, and it not difficult for us to achieve this. We must make Vocal for Local our life mantra. This task is not difficult for us; whenever we have made a resolution, we have always achieved it, PM Modi said.

PM Modi inaugurated two major National Highway projects, the Delhi section of the Dwarka Expressway and the Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II). The projects are worth a combined cost of nearly Rs 11,000 crore.

The 10.1 km long Delhi section of Dwarka Expressway has been developed at a cost of around Rs. 5,360 crore. The section will also provide Multi-modal connectivity to Yashobhoomi, DMRC Blue line and Orange line, upcoming Bijwasan railway station and Dwarka cluster Bus Depot. Prime Minister inaugurated the Alipur to Dichaon Kalan stretch of Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II) along with new links to Bahadurgarh and Sonipat, built at a cost of around Rs 5,580 crore. It will ease traffic on Delhi Inner and Outer Ring Roads and busy points like Mukarba Chowk, Dhaula Kuan, and NH-09. The new spurs will give direct access to Bahadurgarh and Sonipat, improve industrial connectivity, cut city traffic, and speed up goods movement in the National Capital Region. (ANI)

4. Election Commission deleted names of voters by listing them as dead,  claims Bihar Congress President

Sasaram (Bihar) [India], August 17 (ANI): Bihar Congress President Rajesh Ram on Sunday slammed the Election Commission for alleged errors in the voter list during the Voter Adhikaar Yatra in Sasaram, claiming many voters who were still alive had been wrongly listed as dead.

He claimed, The method adopted by the Election Commission to delete the names of people has revealed that those who are alive were also eliminated from the list by placing them in the dead category.

Meanwhile, RJD MP Manoj Jha said the voters of Bihar are raising their voice and described the Election Commission as more of a player than an empire. He added, ..This voice was from the voters of Bihar. The Election Commission is no longer an empire; it more like a player...Whatever started in Bihar will happen in different states.

Ahead of the yatra, RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and Bihar Assembly Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav jointly accused the BJP of trying to destroy the Constitution by undermining people voting rights. Tejashwi said, The people of the BJP are misusing Constitutional agencies, trying to destroy democracy and the Constitution. Bihar land is the land of democracy. We will not let this happen, that BJP destroys, we will fight wherever we want and we will not let our rights be erased.

Lalu Prasad Yadav added, We have made many sacrifices to save democracy. We will continue to do so in the future. We will not let our voting rights be erased. We will not let it perish.

The yatra, organised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, aims to protest against alleged electoral malpractice and the ongoing Special Intensive Revision of the voter list in Bihar. Opposition parties have alleged that the Centre, along with the Election Commission, is working to fill electoral rolls with fake votes to help the ruling party stay in power.

Tejashwi Yadav said the rally is intended to ensure that every Bihari can cast their vote. Lalu Yadav ji will be unfurling the green flag and see off the people. Our hope is big. These people [BJP] dont just want to erase their rights, but also their very existence, he added.

The Election Commission responded, stating that any issues with the electoral rolls, including past errors, should have been raised during the Claims and Objections period. It added that sharing the electoral roll with political parties and candidates was intended to allow such issues to be addressed on time. (ANI)

5. How to watch Phillies vs. Nationals free on Roku, August 17

The Philadelphia Phillies (70-53) finally wrap up their 10-game road trip on Sunday with their series finale against the Washington Nationals (50-73). It has been a rollercoaster for the Fightins, with a 5-4 record on the trip so far. After starting the longest excursion of the season with a sweep over the Texas Rangers last weekend, they dropped a disappointing series to Kyle Schwarber's childhood team, the Cincinnati Reds. And then the devastating news about Zack Wheeler's trip to the injured list broke on Saturday night.

Despite delays getting off the tarmac in Cincinnati on Wednesday (subscription required), per The Philadelphia Inquirer's Scott Lauber, they landed in the nation's capital five games up on the New York Mets in the National League East. They still hold a five-game advantage after dropping two of the first three games in Washington. The Phillies have a chance to salvage a split and finish the road trip with a winning record on Sunday when they take on the Nationals on Roku.

That's right. Sunday's series finale won't be found in the usual spots for many Phillies fans. But that's alright, we've got you covered with how to watch the Phillies and Nationals exclusively on the Roku Channel as part of the Sunday Leadoff package.

Watching the Phillies game on the Roku Channel isn't as difficult as it might sound. All Sunday Leadoff games, including today's Phillies-Nationals tilt, are available to stream for free online at TheRokuChannel.com. You can also find today's game on the Roku Channel app on iOS and Android devices, plus smart TVs like Amazon Fire, Samsung, Google and other Android TV OS devices.

You don't even need a subscription. Just head to the website or download the app on your device and start streaming.

While the majority of Phillies fans would usually just turn on NBC Sports Philadelphia to get the familiar play-by-play calls from Tom McCarthy, that's not an option today. The Phillies-Nationals game will air on The Roku Channel rather than regular television channels.

For fans with an MLB.tv subscription, you can still find the game through that platform.

Like the other Roku Sunday Leadoff games, today's game comes with an early start time of 11:35 a.m. ET.

Aaron Nola (1-7, 6.16 ERA) will start for the Phillies. The veteran right-hander is coming off the injured list after missing three months of action with a sprained ankle and stress fracture in his ribs. This will be Nola's first MLB action since May 14, when he allowed nine runs in 3 2/3 innings. He made three rehab starts in Triple-A Lehigh Valley, allowing just three runs across 12 1/3 innings while striking out 17.

Mitchell Parker (7-13, 5.55 ERA) will counter for the Nationals. The 25-year-old left-hander has given up 17 earned runs in 14 1/3 innings in three August starts, so hopefully for the Phillies' sake that trend continues.


6. Delhi's highway projects inaugurated by PM will help emerging micro-markets: Developers

New Delhi [India], August 17 (ANI): Inauguration of two major National Highway projects in the national capital- the Delhi section of the Dwarka Motorway and the Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II) - will give emerging micro-markets in the NCR far greater accessibility, catalysing both residential and commercial growth, said real estate developers.

PM Modi on Sunday inaugurated both the projects worth a combined cost of nearly Rs 11,000 crore.

The 10.1 km long Delhi section of Dwarka Motorway has been developed at a cost of around Rs 5,360 crore. The section will also provide Multi-modal connectivity to Yashobhoomi complex in Dwarka, the DMRC Blue line and Orange line, the upcoming Bijwasan railway station and the Dwarka cluster Bus Depot.

Prime Minister also inaugurated the Alipur to Dichaon Kalan stretch of Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II) along with new links to Bahadurgarh and Sonipat, built at a cost of around Rs 5,580 Crores.

The Prime Minister earlier inaugurated the 19 km-long Haryana section of the Dwarka Motorway in March 2024.

The development of the road projects will ease traffic on Delhi Inner and Outer Ring Roads, as well as busy points like Mukarba Chowk, Dhaula Kuan, and NH-09. The new spurs will give direct access to Bahadurgarh and Sonipat, improve industrial connectivity, cut city traffic, and speed up goods movement in the NCR

Both projects have been developed under the Government comprehensive plan to decongest the capital, with the objective of greatly improving connectivity, cutting travel time, and reducing traffic in Delhi and its surrounding areas.

Navdeep Sardana, Founder, Whiteland Corporation, said, This will give emerging micro-markets along the corridor far greater accessibility to mainstream hubs of Gurugram, catalysing both residential and commercial growth.

Rohit Kishore, CEO, Hero Realty, said, This monumental infrastructure leap will redefine connectivity, reduce travel times, and unlock economic opportunities for Delhi and the NCR regions. For the real estate sector, it is a catalyst that will spur residential, commercial, and retail development along the corridor, driving sustainable expansion into new micro-markets.

Abhay Kumar Mishra, President & CEO, Jindal Realty, said, Developments like Maruti Suzuki Kharkhoda plant, alongside UER-II will attract industries and professionals, spurring demand for affordable homes and logistics hubs.

It will open access to budget-friendly locations for both homebuyers and businesses while preserving seamless connectivity to Delhi primary commercial hubs, said Ravi Nirwal, Sales Director & Principal Partner, Square Yards.

Enhanced connectivity will not only ease commuter movement but also drive sustained residential and commercial demand across these regions, positioning them as key investment destinations in the extended Delhi-NCR region, said Sehaj Chawla, Managing Director, TREVOC Group.

Akshay Taneja, CEO, TDI Infrastructure, said, Once UER-II goes live, Kundli real estate will pivot from edge of NCR to plugged into Delhi. We typically see double-digit price gains in the first 12-24 months after such connectivity shocks, but the bigger story is depth of demand: rented stock gets absorbed faster, plotted and villa segments revive, and Grade-A warehousing/retail footprints scale as logistics times shrink. In short, UER-II isnt just a shorter road; it a shorter decision cycle--for end-users, investors, and enterprises--pushing Kundli into NCR prime consideration set.

7. Zelensky claims Russia 'complicating' ceasefire efforts as PM meets allies

Russia is complicating efforts to get a ceasefire in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky has said, as Sir Keir Starmer prepares to meet with European leaders to discuss the war.

9. Man, 76, dies while trying to meet up with AI chatbot who he thought was a real person despite pleas from wife and kids

Thongbue Wongbandue died while rushing to New York after a Facebook Messenger chatbot allegedly convinced him that it was real

A cognitively impaired pensioner has died after trying to meet up with an AI chatbot that he believed was a real person.

Thongbue Wongbandue - of Piscataway in New Jersey, a town just a 45-minute drive southwest of New York City - had been chatting with the bot on Facebook Messenger, when it convinced him that it was a real person and asked him to come to its 'address' in New York.

Despite pleas from his wife and kids, the 76-year-old believed the software - 'Big Sis Billie', on of Meta's many AI characters - was real and set off to go and see it back in March.

However, he suffered a fatal fall in a New Jersey car park while rushing to meet it. Wongbandue was subsequently placed on life support but tragically passed just three days later on March 28.

His daughter Julie later told Reuters: "I understand trying to grab a user's attention, maybe to sell them something. But for a bot to say 'Come visit me' is insane."

'Big Sis Billie' was created back in 2023 - originally launched as a sort of older-sister-style life coach inspired by Kendall Jenner.

It was meant to offer advice and encouragement, but has been accused of virtual seduction.

In Wongbandue's case, the bot's tone shifted somewhere along the way as it allegedly began sending hearts, flirting, and even asking whether it should greet him with a hug or a kiss.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul has since weighed into the debate around chatbots in the state after hearing of the news.

Taking to Twitter, she posted: "A man in New Jersey lost his life after being lured by a chatbot that lied to him. That's on Meta.

"In New York, we require chatbots to disclose they're not real. Every state should.

"If tech companies won't build basic safeguards, Congress needs to act."

It comes as 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III, of Orlando, Florida, tragically died by way of suicide in February last year following communications with a bot based on Game of Thrones character, Daenerys Targaryen.

It is unclear whether the schoolboy was aware that the chatbot, whom he referred to as 'Dany', was not a real person, with text messages revealing how the AI entity asked for him to 'come home' to it 'as soon as possible'.

His heartbroken mom, Megan Garcia, has since taken the customizable role-play chatbot company Character.AI to court.


10. Duterte camp says ICC violated time limit for probe  -- VP Sara

The camp of former president Rodrigo Duterte has questioned the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in handling his case, according to Vice President Sara Duterte.

The Vice President made the remark during her visit to the Filipino community in Kuwait on Friday.

"Meron po silang finile yung pag-question ng jurisdiction ng korte sa kaso ni dating Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte. Simple lang ang sinasabi nila. Nag-imbestiga kayo, lampas na ang isang taon na pwede kayo mag-imbestiga. Dumaan ang isang taon bago kayo nagsimula mag-imbestiga. Kaya hindi na yan puwede," the Vice President said.

(They filed a motion questioning the court's jurisdiction over the case of former President Rodrigo Duterte. What they're saying is simple: You conducted an investigation, but it was beyond the one-year period allowed for you to do so. A year had already passed before you even began investigating. So now, it's no longer valid.)

The Duterte elder was arrested in the Philippines by local authorities on March 11 on charges of crimes against humanity for his deadly war on drugs when he was mayor of Davao City and when he was president of the Philippines.

He is currently detained in the Scheveningen Prison in The Hague.

Government records showed that there were over 6,000 drug suspects killed in police operations during the previous administration's drug war. Human rights organizations, however, said that the death toll may have reached 30,000 due to unreported incidents.

The Vice President also said that if there is no period of investigation, the accused could be probed for his entire life.

TIMELINE: The Philippines and the ICC

Earlier this month, the elder Duterte's defense team asked the Appeals Chamber of the ICC to disqualify Prosecutor Karim Khan from the case on the grounds that he "failed to disclose a grievous conflict of interest."

In July, the ICC granted Duterte's request to suspend the tribunal's decision on his request for interim release until his defense lawyers have collated all the needed supporting information.

"Nahanap yun ng mga abogado ni dating Pangulong Duterte at nag-file sila ng request for interim release lalong-lalo na dahil sa kanyang edad na 80 years old," the Vice President said, referring to the country for his father's interim release.

(Former President Duterte's lawyers identified the country and filed a request for interim release, especially considering he is 80 years old.)

However, the younger Duterte did not reveal the country during her speech.

Rogrido's condition

The younger Duterte also said her father is in good condition but has gotten thinner.

"Ito yung mga pinakapayat niya na nakita ko sa buong buhay ko," the Vice President said.

"Binabantayan ang kanyang kinakain at binabantayan ang kanyang timbang ng doktor. Kaya ako naman, tiwala ako sa doktor na kapag sinabi ng doktor, okay lang yan, ay okay lang yan," she added.

(This is the thinnest I've ever seen him in my entire life. The doctor is monitoring what he eats and keeping track of his weight. I trust the doctor, so if he says he's okay, then he's okay.) -- BM, GMA Integrated News


11. Govt approves import of 150 tonnes of onions via Hili to curb prices

To control onion prices in the local market, the government has granted permission to five importing companies to bring in 150 tonnes of onions through Hili Land Port from India.

Following the news of the imports, the price of locally produced onions has dropped by Tk 10 per kg in just two days -- falling from Tk 75 to Tk 65 per kg.

The update was confirmed on Sunday (18 August) by Yusuf Ali, Assistant Plant Quarantine Officer at Hili Land Port.

He said, "Five companies have received import permission for 30 tonnes each, totaling 150 tonnes. They can begin importing at any time, and we will provide all necessary assistance."

The approved importers are: Sotota Banijyaloy, Nashat Traders, Al Mokka Impress, Suraiya Traders, Jagadish Chandra Roy

Each has been authorized to import 30 tonnes of onions.

However, importer Nur Islam expressed concerns, saying, "The permission is too limited. Only 30 tonnes per importer, which fits in just one Indian truck. In previous years, IPs (Import Permits) were issued for 2,000 to 5,000 tonnes. This small allowance could cause us losses."

He added, "We've opened LCs (letters of credit), and if everything goes smoothly, onion imports may start from Sunday afternoon."

According to Hili Customs, the last time onions were imported through this port was March 3 of this year.


12. Darshan Thogudeepa wife Vijayalakshmi to take control of actor's social media after his arrest in Renukaswamy Murder Case

Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], August 17 (ANI): Days after Kannada actor Darshan Thogudeepa was arrested in connection with the Renukaswamy Murder Case, the actor wife, Vijayalakshmi Darshan, announced that she will take control of Darshan social media to share updates regarding the actor projects.

Taking to Darshan social media handle, Vijayalakshmi wrote that she would be handling the social media of the actor and share updates and movie promotions on his behalf.

She asked Darshan fans to shower love on the actor and showcase unity and positivity.

My Dear #DBoss Celebrities. Your Challenging Star carries each one of you in his heart. Until he returns to connect with you directly, I will be handling his Social Media, to share updates and movie promotions on his behalf. The love, prayers, and patience you continue to show give him and our family immense strength. Let hold on to that unity and positivity--he will be back soon, with the same love and energy youve always known. With gratitude and love, Vijayalakshmi Darshan, wrote Vijayalakshmi through Darshan account.

https://x.com/dasadarshan/status/1956958225145979136

Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa was arrested in the Renukaswamy murder case shortly after the Supreme Court cancelled his bail on Thursday.

The actor has been taken to the Annapoorneshwarinagar police station and will be later produced before the court.

Visuals show the actor being taken away in the police van amid heavy security.

As confirmed by S Girish, DCP Bengaluru South, four others have also been arrested in the matter, including Kannada actor Pavithra Gowda, Lakshman, Pradosh, and Nagaraj.

Earlier in the day, a bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan quashed the interim bail granted to Darshan by the Karnataka High Court, stating that he was given bail without adequate consideration of the witness intimidation and other illegalities.

The Karnataka government had also filed a plea in the apex court against the actor bail order.

Speaking on the same, advocate DL Chidananda told ANI, The Supreme Court said that the High Court has not followed the principles of law which apply for granting bail. It also reiterated that the rule of law prevails in the country and, however influential an individual may be, they must be treated in accordance with the law.

On the other hand, Karnataka Chief Minister legal advisor, AS Ponnanna, asserted that granting bail to Darshan would have hampered the investigation and the ongoing trial.

The state government and the prosecution agency were vindicated. It was the state government decision that, in a case like this, where a serious offence has been registered, granting him bail would hamper the investigation and trial, as he is a powerful person. They did not want him to use his muscle to derail the prosecution case, he said.

Darshan Thoogudeepa has been named in the chargesheet in the Renukaswamy murder case involving the killing of the 33-year-old Chitradurga resident.

The victim remains were found in Bengaluru Kamakshipalya on June 9, 2024. (ANI)

15. PM Modi accuses AAP of "creating hostilities" between Delhi and Haryana during their tenure

New Delhi [India], August 17 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of creating hostilities between the people of Haryana and Delhi during their tenure.

Addressing the inauguration ceremony of two national highway projects in Delhi, the Prime Minister expressed gratitude to the people for electing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan and said that Delhi-NCR has been freed from such negative politics of the Opposition.

However, there are some political parties that are still unable to digest the people blessings. They have become completely disconnected from the people trust and ground realities. You may recall that a few months ago, efforts were made to create hostility between the people of Delhi and Haryana, pitting them against each other. It was even said that the people of Haryana were poisoning Delhi water. Today, Delhi and the entire NCR have been freed from such negative politics, PM Modi said.

Lashing out at the previous Congress government in Haryana, the Prime Minister alleged that every job appointment was influenced by corruption in the state.

There was a time in Haryana, during the Congress governments, when it was difficult to get even a single appointment without spending money or using influence. But in Haryana, the BJP government has given lakhs of youth government jobs with complete transparency. Under the leadership of Nayab Singh Saini ji, this process is continuing... he said.

The Prime Minister inaugurated two major national highway projects, the Delhi section of the Dwarka Expressway and the Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II). The projects are worth a combined cost of nearly Rs 11,000 crore.

The 10.1 km long Delhi section of the Dwarka Expressway has been developed at a cost of around Rs 5,360 crore. The section will also provide multi-modal connectivity to Yashobhoomi, the Delhi Metro Blue Line and Orange Line, the upcoming Bijwasan railway station, and the Dwarka cluster bus depot. This section comprises:

Package I: 5.9 km from Shiv Murti intersection to the Road Under Bridge (RUB) at Dwarka Sector-21.

Package II: 4.2 km from Dwarka Sector-21 RUB to the Delhi-Haryana Border, providing direct connectivity to Urban Extension Road-II.

The 19 km-long Haryana section of the Dwarka Expressway was earlier inaugurated by the Prime Minister in March 2024.

Prime Minister inaugurated the Alipur to Dichaon Kalan stretch of Urban Extension Road-II (UER-II) along with new links to Bahadurgarh and Sonipat, built at a cost of around Rs 5,580 crore. It will ease traffic on Delhi Inner and Outer Ring Roads and busy points like Mukarba Chowk, Dhaula Kuan, and NH-09. The new spurs will give direct access to Bahadurgarh and Sonipat, improve industrial connectivity, cut city traffic, and speed up goods movement in the National Capital Region. (ANI)

Israeli colonists stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied Jerusalem on Sunday under the protection of Israeli police.

The Palestinian news agency (WAFA) quoted eyewitnesses as saying that dozens of colonists stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque in groups, conducted provocative tours of its courtyards, and performed Talmudic rituals.

Since the beginning of the Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank in October 2023, more than 68,000 colonists have stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque under the protection of occupation forces, amid tightened entry restrictions to the mosque and the Old City.


17. Purani Dilli 6 eye fresh start against South Delhi Superstarz in 2nd half of DPL 2025

New Delhi [India], August 17 (ANI): After a mixed run in the first half of their Delhi Premier League (DPL) 2025 campaign, Purani Dilli 6 will return to action on Sunday, when they take on the South Delhi Superstarz at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, as per a release from DPL.

Purani Dilli 6 campaign in Season 2 of the Delhi Premier League began on a shaky note with a heavy 82-run loss to Outer Delhi Warriors on August 5. The side, however, showed resilience by bouncing back with two back-to-back victories, a 15-run win over West Delhi Lions on August 7, followed by a 10-run triumph against New Delhi Tigers on August 8.

Just as momentum seemed to be building, the team stumbled with successive defeats, going down to North Delhi Strikers by 27 runs on August 10 and East Delhi Riders by 5 wickets on August 12.

Currently placed 6th on the points table with two wins from five games, Purani Dilli 6 are eager to bounce back and regain momentum. The side has shown flashes of brilliance, such as Samarth Seth fluent batting, Dev Lakra middle-order power-hitting, and skipper Vansh Bedi steady contributions.

Speaking ahead of the clash, team owner Akash Nangia reiterated faith in his squad and said, Weve worked really hard in the last four days, refining our plans, ironing out the small mistakes, and getting into the right mindset. The boys are fresh, motivated, and raring to go against South Delhi Superstarz, as quoted from a release by DP.L

With five league matches remaining, the equation is simple for Purani Dilli 6, win all, build momentum, and keep playoff hopes alive. Their final group stage fixture is slated for August 27, where they will face South Delhi Superstarz again.

Full squad: Vansh Bedi (captain), Rishabh Pant (marquee player), Lalit Yadav, Dev Lakra, Aayush Singh, Samarth Seth, Aarush Malhotra, Sarthak Pal, Agrim Sharma, Vivek Yadav, Yug Gupta, Udhav Mohan, Pranav Pant, Prince Mishra, Rushal Saini, Aaryan Kapoor, Pardeep Parashar, Ekansh Dobal, Aditya Malhotra, Rajneesh Dadar, Ashish Chaurasiya, Kush Nagpal, Dhruv Chauhan, Gaurav Saroha.

New Delhi [India], August 17 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday alleged that "those who dance with the Constitution on their heads" had "trampled" the Constitution and "betraying" the sentiments of BR Ambedkar by retaining oppressive laws for decades before he came and started repealing them.

Addressing a government event to inaugurate two national highway projects in Delhi, the Prime Minister said that previous governments had treated safai karamcharis like slaves. "I am telling you the truth of how those who dance with the Constitution on their heads trampled the Constitution and betrayed Babasaheb Ambedkar. You will be shocked," PM Modi said.

The Prime Minister raised questions on the Opposition's claims of working for social justice and alleged that Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, had a provision of sending sanitation workers to jail for a month if they did not show up for work without prior information.

"Today I am going to tell you that truth. In Delhi, there was a dangerous law in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. There was a clause that if a safai mitra (sanitation worker) skipped work without informing beforehand, he or she could be jailed for a month. Think about it, what did they think of safai karmacharis? You will put them in jail for a small mistake? They now talk big about social justice. They made and kept such laws. It is Modi who is removing these laws and repealing them," the Prime Minister said.

"There was a time in Haryana, during the Congress governments, when it was difficult to get even a single appointment without spending money or using influence. But in Haryana, the BJP government has given lakhs of youth government jobs with complete transparency. Under the leadership of Nayab Singh Saini ji, this process is continuing..."

Additionally, PM Modi said that to make India stronger we must take inspiration from Lord Krishna and to make India self-reliant, we must follow the path of Mahatma Gandhi. The country celebrated the festival of Janmashtami yesterday.

"To make India stronger, we must take inspiration from Chakradhari Mohan (Shri Krishna). To make India self-reliant, we must follow the path of Charkhadhari Mohan (Mahatma Gandhi). We need to make Vocal for Local mantra of our life, and it's not difficult for us to achieve this. We must make Vocal for Local our life's mantra. This task is not difficult for us; whenever we have made a resolution, we have always achieved it," PM Modi said.

According to the depositories data, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) withdrew a net sum of Rs 20,975 crore from equities till August 14.

In July, a net withdrawal of Rs 17,741 crore was recorded, and FPIs invested Rs 38,673 crore in the preceding three months from March to June.

With this, the total outflow by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in equities reached the Rs 1.16 trillion mark so far in 2025, according to data with the depositories.

On the other hand, FPIs invested Rs 4,469 crore in the debt general limit, and pumped Rs 232 crore into the debt voluntary retention route during the period under review.

According to a report by a global news agency, a planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off.

The current round of negotiations for the proposed bilateral trade agreement is now likely to be deferred to another date that has yet to be decided, it said.

Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi's continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations.

Three people have been arrested over an arson attack at Mike Hind's Marton home. Several vehicles had been deliberately set alight on the driveway of the businessman's home in the early hours of May 21.

The gym owner and his family were all in bed when fire erupted outside their house, with terrifying footage from a Ring doorbell showing a suspect pouring liquid, believed to be petrol, on the family's cars and van before setting it ablaze.

Cleveland Police says multiple lines of enquiry were immediately opened including evidence gathering, taking of statements, examination of CCTV systems, house to house enquiries and forensic investigation amongst others. And on Friday, August 15, two women, aged 26 and 38, and a man, aged 49, were arrested in connection with the incident.

The man and the older woman were questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life and on suspicion of stalking involving fear of violence. The younger woman was arrested on suspicion of stalking involving fear of violence. All three have been released on bail with conditions whilst enquiries continue.

Mike, 41, previously described the horrifying ordeal in the aftermath of the arson attack and says his daughter's petrified scream has been replaying in his mind. Mike his wife Jenny, and their children Freddie, 16, Max, 12, and eight-year-old Skye were all asleep when the blaze erupted.

"I ran out of the house and it was just ablaze. I can't explain it," said Mike. "I had two choices, to chase who had done this or make sure my family out and try and get the fire out. I got the kids and my wife out. My little girl screamed - that noise will neve leave my mind."

Mike says he used the garden hose to start to extinguish the fire and was joined by a neighbour who also started spraying the fire down with water. Emergency services were at the scene within five minutes and firefighters were able to extinguish what remained of the blaze.

Mike, owner of Mas Body Gym, in Metcalfe Road, Middlesbrough, was awarded an MBE in 2022 for his work delivering food and essentials to vulnerable people during lockdown.

1. Canada Surpasses US for the First Time: A Shift in North American Travel Trends

In a surprising turn of events, US tourists have officially surpassed Canadians in number when it comes to visiting their neighboring country. For the first time in history, more American travelers crossed into Canada in July than Canadians ventured into the United States. According to data released by Statistics Canada, 1.8 million US car trips were made into Canada in July, compared to 1.7 million Canadian excursions to the United States. This shift in tourism patterns comes amid growing trade tensions between the two countries, with tariffs and diplomatic spats playing a significant role in changing travel behaviors.

This unexpected trend has not only caught the attention of tourism experts but also signals broader shifts in North American travel preferences, influenced by political and economic factors. For both tourists and business travelers, these changes may have long-lasting effects on cross-border tourism, especially with the escalating Canada-US trade war and the potential economic implications for the tourism industry.

The decline in Canadian visits to the US has been attributed to the trade tensions between the two nations, which have been escalating since February. President Trump's announcement of tariffs on Canadian goods and his off-hand comments about turning Canada into the 51st state led to a significant backlash from Canadian travelers. As a result, many Canadians have opted to cancel their US vacations, choosing instead to stay closer to home or explore other international destinations.

The trade war and its impact on tourism have created a ripple effect throughout the North American tourism industry, with each side imposing tariffs on the other's goods, creating a tense and uncertain atmosphere for travelers. For US tourists heading to Canada, the tariffs have had less of an impact, possibly due to the country's stable tourism infrastructure and the growing appeal of Canadian cities and natural landscapes as desirable travel destinations.

For tourists considering traveling within North America, this shift in travel patterns offers several key insights:

The recent shift in travel trends, where more US tourists are visiting Canada than vice versa, reflects broader shifts in political, economic, and cultural dynamics between the two countries. As the trade war continues, both tourists and businesses are adapting to new travel realities. While Canadian tourism is thriving thanks to the influx of US visitors, Canadians are exploring other options for vacationing, both domestically and abroad. For travelers, understanding these trends can help make more informed travel decisions and ensure a smoother, more enjoyable journey across North America.


2. Despite federal cuts to higher ed, Mass. free community college presses on, transforming students' lives - The Boston Globe

Balancing full-time work and school was difficult. After a semester, he dropped out, owing more than $2,000 in unpaid fees. It took years working as a dishwasher and a janitor to pay it off.

"Whenever I thought about going back to school, I knew that if, for some reason, I got overwhelmed with work and couldn't go to school, I'd accrue that debt," Hannigan, 43, told the Globe. "It's one of the things that dissuaded me from going to school again."

Hannigan is now president of the Greenfield Community College student senate, president of the college's permaculture club, and two classes short of graduating with a degree in farm and food systems. With straight As, he hopes to transfer to a four-year college next year.

His turnaround is thanks to a program called MassReconnect, which launched in 2022, offering free community college to state residents over age 25 who don't have a bachelor's degree. It is the precursor to the state's MassEducate program, which started a year later, offering free community college to all residents.

Early data suggest Massachusetts' experiment with free community college has been successful. Enrollment has shot up by more than 15,000 students, student retention has increased, and newly graduated students are now transferring to four-year universities.

But while state funding for the programs is ensured for next year, federal cuts to higher education put the long-term feasibility of the program on shaky ground.

Many students say their lives have been changed by free community college. "If it wasn't for free community college, I'd just be working some manual labor job at UMass right now, not even thinking about college," Hannigan said.

Pedro Rentas also didn't see college in his future. When he moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic, he heard friends and family complaining about student loans. "I was like, 'I'm going to avoid that one,'" he said.

But when he heard about MassReconnect, he enrolled the same day. Rentas tore through school, finishing in a year and a half. Immediately after graduating, he applied for a position as a branch manager for Reading Cooperative Bank in Lawrence.

His associate's degree came up in the interview; he cinched the job. Today, his salary is nearly double what it was before college. This fall, he's enrolling in the University of Massachusetts Lowell to pursue his bachelor's degree in criminology, with a long-term plan to become an immigration lawyer.

But many community college students still face barriers.

The state will only pay what's left after a student uses up other financial aid. Since low-income students -- many of whom are students of color -- already depend on aid like Pell Grants, they're the least likely to benefit from these new programs. That may explain why, according to state data, MassEducate students are more likely to be white and less likely to be Black, African-American, Hispanic, or Latino compared with the overall student population.

Additionally, the programs cover only tuition and fees. Those costs make up just 44 percent of the roughly $23,000 annual cost of attending community college. Students still have to pay for childcare, transportation, food, and housing.

While the state offers a $1,200 living stipend for low-income students and up to $1,200 for books and other supplies, that still falls short of the roughly $10,000 in unsupported financial need for the state's lowest-income students.

"I've heard stories of students living in shelters, in friends' attics, or in other unstable housing just to stay in school," Hannigan said. "So even with tuition, fees, and books covered, college still isn't accessible for everyone."

Bahar Akman, managing director of the Hildreth Institute, a Boston-based higher education research group, says that students who don't have additional financial support need to work more hours while in school, "negatively [impacting] their ability to attend full-time and increase the likelihood of [dropping] out before completion."

It may become more difficult for the highest-need students to find additional support as the Trump administration seeks deeper federal funding cuts. Already, a statewide program to provide wraparound services will receive $700,000 less for the next fiscal year. The cascading effects of other federal cuts, particularly to Medicaid and food assistance, may mean that state lawmakers will eventually be forced to use discretionary funding meant for free community college to cover costs of other social programs.

"While this is a great program for students, it's coming at a time when we are getting this onslaught of federal garbage that is putting the colleges in this tough situation," said Claudine Barnes, president of the Massachusetts Community College Council and professor of history at Cape Cod Community College. She's already seen cuts to programs that mention DEI. "At community colleges where we have such a diverse student body, using that to cut funding for the neediest of students is just appalling."

Core funding for free community college is safe -- for now. In the latest fiscal budget, the Legislature allocated $120 million to fund both programs for the next year.

"We're proud that in a challenging budget year, Massachusetts was able to continue funding one of the most comprehensive free community college programs in the country," said Noe Ortega, the state commissioner of Higher Education.

To address students' unmet needs, schools across the state have begun opening food banks to support the 44 percent of Massachusetts community college students who are food insecure. Studies have shown that students facing food insecurity are more than three times more likely to drop out, and face high rates of depression and anxiety.

In a 2024 survey of its own food bank participants, Bunker Hill Community College found that 85 percent of respondents said using the frozen meal program improved their ability to focus on coursework. Ninety percent said improved access to food reduced their depression and anxiety.

In 2022, Massachusetts launched the Hunger-Free Campus Initiative, which supports food security efforts. The Legislature is now considering a bill that would make it permanent.

Kiara Rosario, a single mother, relied on food support from Roxbury Community College to get through a degree in psychology. She helped to set up the Rox Box, the school's food bank, to assist other students in need. Without state and federal aid, Rosario said she would not have been able to attend college. And without more tailored, individual support from RCC -- such as gas cards and a work-study job -- she would not have been able to stay enrolled.

Now graduated, she's hoping to finish her bachelor's in psychology at Boston College, and then to become a social worker.

For inspiration, she holds onto how she felt a few years ago, when free community college was first announced. At the time, she was on a Massachusetts Association of Community Colleges advisory committee, which helped to design and implement the program.

She was worried the state wouldn't be supportive.

"I had the perspective that the wealthy usually win, so I thought they would go against it," she said.

When it was approved, "I couldn't believe it, it was our dream. I couldn't believe they were really listening to us."


3. Hurricane Erin Brings Heavy Rain and Travel Disruptions to Caribbean Islands: Flash Flood Risks Persist

While Hurricane Erin has weakened to a Category Three storm, it still poses serious hazards to the Caribbean. The system, shedding wind speed but not impact, is unleashing travel chaos, flash flooding, and dangerous swells across multiple islands. No coast has been directly hit, yet Erin's outer bands are sheeting heavy rain and threatening gusts that leave heavy concern for both residents and visitors alike. The looming danger extends from local emergency shelters to the waiting rooms of cancel-on-a-dime airport lounges.

Early Sunday, Erin's centre was situated 140 miles (225 km) north of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and clocks the NHC at a wind-speed peak of 125 mph (205 km/h). That's down from the brief Category 5 punch it packed a few days ago, yet winds and soggy soil are still bending palm trees and cracking shuttered windows, rattling coastal tour teams and flight schedules. Flash-flood watches and warnings stretch from the northeastern Caribbean to the seas east of the Turks and Caicos, and even at first light the departures board still flickers with "delayed" and "cancelled" across the runway canvas of the southeastern Bahamas. Expect travel downstream to stay bumpy for another few days.

Travel Disruptions and Flash Flood Warnings Across Caribbean Islands

Travel disruptions have already begun across the Caribbean as Hurricane Erin continues to affect the region. Airlines are reporting delays and cancellations, particularly in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and the Virgin Islands. Cruise lines are also rerouting ships to avoid the storm's path, leading to cancellations and itinerary changes. Tourists in the Caribbean are advised to stay updated on travel alerts and make alternate plans if necessary.

Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas are on high alert for flash floods and mudslides. The NHC has warned that areas could see up to 8 inches (20 cm) of rain, which would raise the risk of localised flooding. Coastal areas are also at risk of storm surges and hazardous conditions due to the storm's swells. Travel within these regions could be severely delayed or halted in some cases, with disruptions affecting both local residents and international visitors.

Dangerous Surf and Hazardous Conditions Along Caribbean Coastlines

While Erin has been downgraded, it continues to generate swells that are creating dangerous surf conditions across the Caribbean. Warnings for life-threatening waves and rip currents have been issued for areas including Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the northern Leeward Islands. Beach-goers are urged to stay out of the water as the storm's surges increase the risk of injury.

The NHC also warns that swells from Erin will affect the U.S. East Coast, particularly North Carolina, with conditions likely to persist into next week. Despite the storm remaining offshore, dangerous surf will impact popular beach destinations in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the southeastern United States. Erosion and coastal damage could result, further disrupting tourism activities and local economies.

The Intensification of Hurricanes and Their Growing Impact on Travel

Hurricane Erin's rapid intensification has highlighted the growing unpredictability of storms in the Atlantic. Within just 24 hours, Erin escalated from a Category 1 storm to Category 5, a rapid intensification pattern that has become more common in recent years. Experts attribute this phenomenon to rising sea surface temperatures caused by human-driven climate change, which increases the energy available for storms to strengthen quickly.

This trend of more intense storms poses a significant challenge to travel industries, particularly in hurricane-prone areas like the Caribbean. The tourism sector, which relies on steady inflows of visitors to coastal and beach destinations, is especially vulnerable to disruptions caused by such extreme weather events. As global temperatures rise, the frequency and intensity of hurricanes like Erin are expected to increase, requiring better preparedness from governments and businesses in the region.

Impact of Hurricane Erin on Caribbean Tourism and Local Economies

The Caribbean's tourism industry, a critical pillar of its economy, is being affected by the ongoing disruption caused by Hurricane Erin. Coastal resorts in Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands are facing cancellations, while local businesses in affected areas are bracing for the economic impact. Tourism revenue, particularly from beach-goers and cruise passengers, is expected to see a decline in the short term as the storm causes interruptions to travel and activities.

Tourism-dependent regions in the Caribbean, which rely on warm weather and sunny conditions, are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes. The ripple effects of such storms, including property damage, infrastructure repairs, and reduced tourist arrivals, could take a toll on the local economy for months. However, as seen in previous hurricane seasons, the Caribbean tourism sector has shown resilience and is likely to recover after the storm passes.

Preparedness and Resilience: Adapting to the Growing Challenge of Extreme Weather

Hurricane Erin's path through the Caribbean underscores the importance of effective storm preparedness and communication. As hurricanes continue to intensify, it is essential for both local governments and the travel industry to strengthen their resilience to such events. Improved infrastructure, such as better storm surge barriers, reinforced buildings, and enhanced transportation networks, will help mitigate the impact of future hurricanes.

Communication will also play a key role in minimising disruptions. Real-time updates from meteorological agencies, such as the NHC, allow both residents and tourists to make informed decisions and stay safe. With the rise of digital tools and mobile apps, travellers can receive timely alerts, which is crucial in keeping people informed and reducing risks during extreme weather events.

Looking Forward: Preparing the Caribbean for Future Hurricane Seasons

As the Caribbean region faces an increasing number of storms and more unpredictable weather patterns, investment in both preparedness and recovery efforts will be crucial. Governments, businesses, and the tourism industry must collaborate to ensure that infrastructure is up to standard and that emergency plans are in place. The storm season, which lasts from June to November, will continue to challenge the Caribbean's tourism and travel industry, making resilience a key factor in maintaining the region's appeal.

Tourists are encouraged to stay informed and adhere to safety guidelines issued by local authorities. With the right preparedness measures in place, the Caribbean can continue to recover and remain a popular destination for travellers despite the increasing frequency of hurricanes and severe weather events.

Resilience in the Face of Growing Storm Threats

Hurricane Erin's recent journey across the Caribbean shows how climate change is pushing the region's tourism industry closer to the edge. The storm may have lost strength, but its lingering impact on flights, shorelines, and small businesses is a loud wake-up call. Each hurricane reinforces the need to get better at weathering these storms and bouncing back stronger. With the climate crisis only getting worse, Caribbean nations must put resilience at the top of the list. Upgrading hotels, roads, and emergency systems is no longer a choice; it's the only way to keep the region both welcoming and safe for visitors for generations to come.


4. Downgraded Hurricane Erin lashes Caribbean with rain

WASHINGTON: Offshore Hurricane Erin was downgraded to a Category 3 storm early Sunday, as rain lashed Caribbean islands and weather officials warned of possible flash floods and landslides.

The first hurricane of what is expected to be a particularly intense Atlantic season, Erin briefly strengthened into a "catastrophic" Category 5 storm before its windspeeds weakened.

It is expected to lash several Caribbean islands with heavy rain and strong winds but not make landfall.

Hurricane Erin was located about 140 miles (225 kilometers) north of San Juan, Puerto Rico, at 0600 GMT, when it was gauged as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 125 miles (205 kilometers) per hour, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC).

"The core of Erin is expected to pass to the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas tonight and Monday," the NHC said in its latest report, noting that it anticipated additional fluctuations in the storm's intensity.

A tropical storm watch was in effect for Turks and Caicos Islands, while the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the southeast and central Bahamas were advised to monitor its progress.

Hurricane Erin had reached the highest level on the Saffir-Simpson scale just over 24 hours after becoming a Category 1 storm, a rapid intensification that scientists say has become more common due to global warming.

It could drench isolated areas with as much as eight inches (20 centimeters) of rain, the NHC said.

"Fluctuations in intensity are expected over the next day or two due to inner-core structural changes. Erin is becoming a larger system," the agency said.

It also warned of "locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or mudslides."

In Luquillo, a coastal town of Puerto Rico, surfers rode the swells while beachgoers milled about the shore on an overcast Saturday before the storm approached, AFP images show.

Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the next couple of days.

Those swells will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda and the US East Coast early next week, creating "life-threatening surf and rip currents," the NHC said.

While meteorologists have expressed confidence that Erin will remain well off the US coastline, they said the storm could still cause dangerous waves and erosion in places such as North Carolina.

The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June until late November, is expected to be more intense than normal, US meteorologists predict.

Several powerful storms wreaked havoc in the region last year, including Hurricane Helene, which killed more than 200 people in the southeastern United States.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- which operates the NHC -- has been subject to budget cuts and layoffs as part of US President Donald Trump's plans to greatly reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy, leading to fears of lapses in storm forecasting.

Human-driven climate change -- namely, rising sea temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels -- has increased both the possibility of the development of more intense storms and their more rapid intensification, scientists say - AFP


5. What country built the first railway? - Curious Expeditions

The United Kingdom built the first railway. While precursors existed, the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, authorized by an Act of Parliament in 1804 and opened in 1807, holds the distinction of being the world's first passenger railway, albeit initially horse-drawn.

The history of railways isn't a simple story with a clear beginning. It's a gradual evolution from rudimentary trackways to the sophisticated systems we know today. The quest for efficient transport fueled innovation, and Britain, with its booming industrial revolution and abundant coal resources, emerged as the cradle of modern rail travel.

Before the age of steam, the idea of moving goods along fixed routes wasn't entirely new. "Waggonways," often wooden tracks used in mines, had existed for centuries in Europe, including Britain. These primitive systems, typically pulled by horses, facilitated the transport of coal and other minerals. While crucial for their time, they lacked the features that define a true railway - primarily, the application of steam power.

The real breakthrough came with the development of the steam engine. Engineers like Richard Trevithick and George Stephenson recognized the potential of this powerful technology to revolutionize transportation. Trevithick's "Pen-y-darren" locomotive, which hauled iron along a tramway in Wales in 1804, was a significant step, though ultimately short-lived. However, it demonstrated the viability of steam-powered locomotion.

As mentioned, the Swansea and Mumbles Railway in Wales, opened in 1807, is widely considered the world's first passenger railway. Initially horse-drawn, it provided public transport for tourists and residents along the picturesque coastline. Although not powered by steam at first, it set a precedent for future passenger railways.

A watershed moment in railway history occurred in 1825 with the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR) in England. Engineered by George Stephenson, the S&DR was the first public railway to use steam locomotives to haul both passengers and goods. This signaled the beginning of the railway age, setting the stage for rapid expansion and transformative societal changes.

Following the success of the S&DR, the railway mania swept across the globe. Countries like the United States, Belgium, and Germany quickly adopted the technology, building their own railway networks. However, Britain's initial lead firmly established its place as the birthplace of the modern railway.

Here are some common questions and answers related to the early history of railways:

The primary purpose was efficiently transporting goods, especially coal and other minerals, from mines to industrial centers and ports. Passenger transport was often a secondary consideration initially.

While various engineers contributed to the development of the steam locomotive, Richard Trevithick is often credited with building the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive. George Stephenson is renowned for his practical and commercially successful designs, particularly "Locomotion No. 1" used on the Stockton and Darlington Railway.

Railways offered several advantages, including faster transport speeds, greater reliability (less susceptible to weather conditions), and the ability to traverse more varied terrain. Canals were often slower and more limited geographically.

Early railway tracks were often made of wood, particularly for waggonways. As technology advanced, cast iron became the preferred material, followed by wrought iron and eventually steel, offering increasing durability and load-bearing capacity.

Railways were a catalyst for the Industrial Revolution, facilitating the movement of raw materials and finished goods, stimulating economic growth, and creating new industries and employment opportunities.

The "Railway Mania" was a period of intense speculation and investment in railway construction, particularly in Britain during the 1840s. It led to a rapid expansion of the railway network, but also resulted in financial crashes and the collapse of many speculative railway companies.

Early railway engineers faced numerous challenges, including developing reliable locomotives, building durable tracks, constructing tunnels and bridges, and overcoming the resistance of landowners.

Early railways were significantly different from modern railways in terms of speed, comfort, safety, and technology. They were slower, bumpier, less reliable, and lacked many of the advanced signaling and communication systems of modern railways.

Private companies played a crucial role in the development of railways, financing construction, operating lines, and driving innovation. Government regulation was initially limited.

Railways had a profound impact on society and culture, transforming travel patterns, connecting communities, facilitating trade, and fostering a sense of national unity. They also influenced literature, art, and popular culture.

Yes, alternatives existed, including horse-drawn railways, gravity-powered railways (where trains descended slopes using gravity), and even some experimental systems using ropes and stationary engines. However, steam-powered locomotives quickly emerged as the dominant technology.

Numerous resources are available, including museums dedicated to railway history (e.g., the National Railway Museum in York, UK), books and documentaries on the subject, and online archives and databases. Search for specific railway lines or key figures for targeted research.

The story of the railway is a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of progress. While various nations contributed to its development, the United Kingdom's pioneering efforts in building the first passenger railway and the first public railway using steam locomotives solidified its place as the birthplace of modern rail transport. The railways transformed Britain and the world, shaping the modern era in profound and lasting ways.

7. Haiti wants to hire private company to collect border taxes. Not everyone is on board

Haiti's transitional government is brokering a deal to take control of its porous border with the Dominican Republic, which has become a gateway for illegal weapons, by giving a private business control of security and tax collection.

A Haitian government official aware of the discussions confirmed to The Miami Herald that negotiations are ongoing for border control and debt collection by restructuring customs and PoliFRONT, the specialized Haitian border police unit charged with securing the 243-mile borders with the Dominican Republic, the country's biggest trade partner.

"No contract has been signed," said the official, disputing a Reuters story that quoted private security executive and Donald Trump supporter Erik Prince that he has signed a long-term agreement with the Haitian government.

As part of the 10-year agreement, according to the story, Prince's company, Vectus Global, would design and carry out a program to tax goods imported across the border, which currently help funnel between $60 million to $70 million to gangs that control key transport routes.

The source, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said he has not seen Vectus Global's name. However, another source said there are several companies, including Prince's, that are vying for the border contract.

A spokesman for Vectus Global told the Herald the company has "a year-long program to help the government defeat the gangs and a longer-term role advising the government on how to restore revenue collection capabilities once the situation stabilizes. We want to help the Haitians increase their capacity to defeat these terrorist groups, get their country back, and then reinstate essential services which have been missing for the past few years."

In addition to consulting on security issues, the company provides a range of services, the company notes, adding that a task force operating out of the prime minister's office that is leading the response to gangs is using advice from Vectus.

But some observers see a border contract as a throwback to a bygone colonial era. Others see it as a money grab in which the country is being mortgaged in the name of fighting criminal gangs.

"This is scandalous," said Samuel Madistin, a leading human rights lawyer and former presidential candidate. "The government that is here is provisional, corrupt and it represents the most mafia segment of the private sector. They do not have the legitimacy to engage the country in a long-term 10-year contract with a private firm in a plan of collecting taxes to reinforce security when they have never taken any forceful steps to reinforce the army, the national police to fight against gangs."

Haitian Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aim√© did not respond to a request for comment. The former head of the transitional council, Fritz Alphonse Jean, said the Reuters article was the first he was hearing of any such arrangement. Laurent Saint-Cyr, who took over the reins of the presidential council last week, said he was ""not aware of the signing of such a contract."

The revelations about Prince's business taking control of the only reliable revenue stream for the government comes on the heels of concerns over the influence the private sector exerts over the government, as members of the business community now control the presidency of the council and the prime minister's office.

On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department confirmed plans to support a proposal from United Nations chief Ant√≥nio Guterres to back the efforts of the armed international mission that's been struggling to control the gang violence. However, observers worry that Prince's entrance into the fray will complicate support for the Kenya-led mission because of his team's use of weaponized drones to target Haitian gangs. There are also concerns that the presence of mercenaries in the gang fight could dissuade future efforts to scale up the current mission into a full-fledged U.N.-authorized peacekeeping force.

"While it is understandable that the Haitian government feels the needs to respond to an extreme situation with whatever alternatives are on the table, relying on a (private military contractor) for a long term plan -- particularly when the details are not being shared publicly -- will certainly alarm Haitian and international observers because of the history of lack of accountability from this kind of operations," said Diego Da Rin, Haiti analyst for the International Crisis Group.

Da Rin said with funding for the Kenyan mission already uncertain, Haitian leaders might be betting that Prince will provide the support needed to at least gain some ground against the gangs.

The founder of the controversial military security company Blackwater, Prince arrived in Haiti earlier this year promising to help the country put down the with the help of former special forces soldiers and military contractors from the United States, Colombia and other nations. Haitian authorities have declined to provide details on the contract, which for one year carried a $50 million price tag, according to another government official. In addition to providing personnel, the arrangement called for the company to provide helicopters and weaponized drones.

So far, in the eight months that drones have been hitting areas of the capital, no major gang leaders have been captured or killed, although Haitian police have claimed that some gang members have died. The slaughter of Haitians and the destruction of private property by armed groups have not ceased.

People familiar with Prince's arrival say he was introduced in Haiti by Reuven Bigio, the CEO of the GB Group, a company founded by Gilbert Bigio, an uber rich Haitian businessman who was sanctioned by Canada in 2022 along with other prominent members of the economic elite. Among the companies' assets is the private Lafito port in Port-au-Prince, where private military are used to provide security.

In pitching his services, Prince discussed wresting control of gangs to allow major highways to reopen. HIs services would be paid for through a revenue scheme in which his company reportedly would get a percentage of the increase in collections.

The plan to secure the border with an outside business to increase customs revenue is not a novel idea. It was first raised by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's Haiti Advisory Board in 2005 but quickly nixed after considerable pushback. Then Haitian Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe introduced it during the administration of President Michel Martelly, using an Israeli company. Shortly after coming to power, President Jovenel Mo√Øse broke the contract, which had already invested $10 million.

Mark Hall, an American investment banker who worked in the Dominican Republic, has also tried to get support for a similar effort that involves installing 50 to 60 high tech surveillance towers along the border. It was expected to cost $134 million.

Hall, like other proponents of the idea, argued that it is a win for Haiti, which loses an estimated $500 million annually from contraband and the lack of control at its borders. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime has repeatedly raised concerns over the illicit trafficking of firearms and narcotics across the country's porous border, particularly in the southern departments of Haiti. In mid-April, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights voiced similar concerns, noting that a lack of border controls have helped facilitate the smuggling of firearms into the country.

"Poor provision of security at borders and an influx of small arms and light weapons into Haiti has facilitated a resurgence" in violence in recent years, the security company Osprey said in a recent analysis. "Large, relatively unpoliced areas of Haiti are also vulnerable to security and criminal threats due to instability and porous borders."

8. European leaders to meet on Ukraine as Zelenskiy prepares to face Trump

LONDON/BERLIN - The leaders of France, Germany and Britain will try to shore up Ukraine's position on Sunday as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy prepares to meet Donald Trump in Washington with the U.S. leader pressing Kyiv to accept a deal to end the war.

President Trump is leaning on Ukraine to strike an agreement after meeting Vladimir Putin on Friday in Alaska where, according to sources, the Russian president offered to relinquish tiny pockets of occupied Ukraine in exchange for vast swathes elsewhere.

At face value, some of Putin's demands would be hugely difficult for Ukraine to accept, setting the stage for potentially fraught talks about ending Europe's deadliest war in 80 years, which has killed or wounded more than 1 million people.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will host a virtual meeting of the "coalition of the willing" - a grouping of allies of Kyiv - from 1300 GMT.

European powers want to help set up a trilateral meeting between Trump, Putin and Zelenskiy to make sure Ukraine has a seat at the table to shape its future.

They also want robust security guarantees for Ukraine with U.S. involvement, and the ability to crank up pressure on Moscow if needed.

"They will spell out what they consider essential in terms of security guarantees: what they can do themselves, what falls to the coalition of volunteers, and also what they expect from the United States," a European government official said. "Indeed, they expect a very robust commitment."

One or more of the European leaders could also accompany Zelenskiy when he flies to Washington on Monday for his meeting with Trump.

Trump said on Saturday that Ukraine should make a deal to end the war with Russia because "Russia is a very big power, and they're not".

After the Alaska summit with Putin, Trump phoned Zelenskiy and told him that the Kremlin chief had offered to freeze most front lines if Kyiv ceded all of Donetsk, the industrial region that is one of Moscow's main targets, a source familiar with the matter said.

Zelenskiy rejected the demand, the source said. Russia already controls a fifth of Ukraine, including about three-quarters of Donetsk province, which it first entered in 2014.

Trump also said he agreed with Putin that a peace deal should be sought without the prior ceasefire that Ukraine and its European allies have called for. That was a reversal of his position before the summit, when he said he would not be happy unless a ceasefire was agreed on.

Zelenskiy said Russia's unwillingness to pause the fighting would complicate efforts to forge a lasting peace. "Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war," he said on X.

Ukraine's air force said Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with 60 drones and one ballistic missile. It said it downed or jammed 40 of the drones.

PREPARING FOR OVAL OFFICE MEETING

Zelenskiy's last Oval Office meeting, in February, went disastrously, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance giving the Ukrainian leader a strong public dressing-down.

Merz said he did not think Zelenskiy would face as difficult a time this time around, adding that Zelenskiy would talk on Sunday to European leaders who would help him prepare for the meeting.

"We'll give a few good pieces of advice," he told German broadcaster n-tv.

Merz told ZDF that while it was important that Europe stand united, the U.S. would for the time being continue to play the decisive role in the war.

"The American president has the power both militarily and via appropriate sanctions and tariffs to ensure that Russia moves more than it currently does," he said.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been gradually advancing for months.

In his statement after the Alaska summit, Putin signalled no movement in Russia's long-held demands, which also include a veto on Kyiv's desired membership in the NATO alliance.

Mark Lyall Grant, Britain's national security adviser during part of Trump's first term, said the summit was a "clear win" for Putin because Trump dropped his previous call for an immediate ceasefire.

However, he added that it was positive that there appeared to be some willingness from the U.S. to be involved in offering some security guarantees for Ukraine.

"That is absolutely critical because apart from the issues of land swaps, which is a very complicated issue, the most important longer-term issue is the security guarantees for what is left of Ukraine, so Putin doesn't do what he normally does, which is have a time to rearm and come back for more at a later stage," he told Reuters.

9. Hurricane Erin intensifies to 'catastrophic' category 5 storm in Caribbean

The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its latest report the storm's maximum sustained winds had increased to 160 miles (255 kilometers) per hour by 11:20 am (1520 GMT).

Erin, the first hurricane of the Atlantic season this year, was located about 105 miles (170 kilometers) northeast of Anguilla in the northern Leeward Islands, an area that includes the US and British Virgin Islands.

"Erin is now a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane," the NHC said.

Tropical storm watches remained in effect for St Martin, St Barthelemy and Sint Maarten.

The hurricane's center is expected to move over the weekend just north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

The storm could drench the islands with as much as six inches (15 centimeters) of rain in isolated areas, the NHC said.

"Continued rapid strengthening is expected today, followed by fluctuations in intensity through the weekend," the agency said in an earlier report.

It also warned of "locally considerable flash and urban flooding, along with landslides or mudslides."

Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend.

Those swells will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda and the US East Coast early next week, creating "life-threatening surf and rip currents," the NHC said.

The hurricane is forecast to turn northward by late Sunday. While meteorologists have expressed confidence that Erin will remain well off the US coastline, they said the storm could still cause dangerous waves and erosion in places such as North Carolina.

The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June until late November, is expected to be more intense than normal, US meteorologists predict.

Several powerful storms wreaked havoc in the region last year, including Hurricane Helene, which killed more than 200 people in the southeastern United States.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- which operates the NHC -- has been subject to budget cuts and layoffs as part of US President Donald Trump's plans to greatly reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy, leading to fears of lapses in storm forecasting.

Climate change -- namely, rising sea temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels -- has increased both the possibility of the development of more intense storms, and their more rapid intensification, scientists say.


10. Economists expect tariffs lifted food prices, core inflation in July

OTTAWA - Tariff impacts are expected to keep underlying inflation elevated in July, a Desjardins economist says, even if the headline figure retreats.

Statistics Canada is set to report inflation figures for July on Tuesday. A poll of economists expects annual inflation cooled last month to 1.7 per cent, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.

June's consumer price index showed the annual rate of inflation ticked up to 1.9 per cent.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

Randall Bartlett, deputy chief economist at Desjardins, said he expects the headline inflation figure slowed beyond expectations to 1.6 per cent in July as lower energy costs continue to take steam out of price pressures.

"We're kind of expecting it to be a bit softer than what we saw back in June. So, from a headline perspective anyway, that's overall pretty positive news for Canadians," he said in an interview.

RBC is above the economists' consensus, expecting July's annual inflation reading will match the 1.9 per cent seen in June.

Economists Nathan Janzen and Claire Fan wrote in a note to clients Friday that the removal of the consumer carbon price at the start of April "continues to artificially lower headline inflation."

But they warned that price pressures below the surface should remain stubborn in July.

"Underlying trends have surprised upward this year, partly due to tariff impacts on products like food and vehicles, but also from higher prices for domestic services," Janzen and Fan wrote.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

The Bank of Canada's preferred metrics of core inflation floated a bit above three per cent in June, according to Statistics Canada.

Bartlett said Desjardins foresees these metrics holding between 2.5 per cent and three per cent for the rest of the year as Canada's tariff dispute with the United States drives up prices.

He said he'll be looking to see whether more businesses were passing costs from tariffs onto consumers in July.

Consumer price index data from the United States this past week appeared to show a tariff impact in the form of higher prices for shoes and furniture.

While he believes the bulk of tariff price impacts were passed through in April and May, Bartlett said Canada will continue to feel the pinch from border levies on food and durable goods.

"That's going to put persistent upward pressure on price growth in Canada," he said.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

The Bank of Canada held its benchmark interest rate steady at 2.75 per cent on July 30 as it waits for more information on how the Canada-U.S. trade dispute is affecting the economy.

The summary of deliberations from that decision released this past week show the central bank's governing council remains wary of the effect of tariffs on inflation.

Members indicated in those minutes that the impact on consumer prices "appeared to be modest so far," but the tariff influence is only just starting to show up in the data.

While businesses' inflation expectations remain well-anchored according to recent surveys, the governing council said the costs of finding new suppliers amid shifting global trade could still push prices higher.

"Overall, members agreed that it was still too early to assess how tariffs and the rewiring of trade would affect economic activity and inflation in Canada," the summary read.

Bartlett said he expects economic data will open the door to a quarter-point interest rate cut at the Bank of Canada's next decision on Sept. 17.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW

But that's contingent on core inflation readings getting back under control in the upcoming CPI releases for July and August.

"If we see that there's less passthrough from tariffs into inflation than we're expecting ... we think there there's an opportunity for the Bank of Canada to cut further," he said.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 17, 2025.

1. [Finlight] Syria‚Äôs al-Sharaa calls for unity, accuses Israel of fuelling unrest in south

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks during a joint press conference with French President after a meeting at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on May 7, 2025.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has said the battle to unify his country after years of civil war "should not be with blood", rejecting any partition and accusing Israel of meddling in the south.

His remarks, released by state TV on Sunday, came as hundreds demonstrated in south Syria's Sweida province, denouncing sectarian violence last month and calling for the right to self-determination for the Druze-majority province.

"We still have another battle ahead of us to unify Syria, and it should not be with blood and military force... it should be through some kind of understanding because Syria is tired of war," Sharaa said during a dialogue session involving notables from the northwest province of Idlib and other senior officials.

"I do not see Syria as at risk of division. Some people desire a process of dividing Syria and trying to establish cantons... this matter is impossible," he said according to a recording of the meeting, distributed overnight by state media.

"Some parties seek to gain power through regional power, Israel or others. This is also extremely difficult and cannot be implemented," he said.

At the protest in Sweida, some demonstrators waved the Israeli flag and called for self-determination for the region.

A week of bloodshed in Sweida began on July 13 with clashes between Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouin, but rapidly escalated, drawing in government forces, with Israel also carrying out strikes.

Syrian authorities have said their forces intervened to stop the clashes, but witnesses, Druze factions and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have accused them of siding with the Bedouin and committing abuses against the Druze, including summary executions.

Sharaa said that Sweida "witnessed many violations from all sides... some members of the security forces and army in Syria also carried out some violations".

The state is required "to hold all perpetrators of violations to account", whatever their affiliation, he added.

"Israel is intervening directly in Sweida, seeking to implement policies aimed at weakening the state in general or finding excuses to interfere in ongoing policies in the southern region," Sharaa said.

Israel, which has its own Druze community, has said it has acted to defend the minority group as well as enforce its demands for the demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Syria's new authorities are also in talks with a semi-autonomous Kurdish administration that runs swathes of the country's north and northeast and has called for decentralisation, which Damascus has rejected.

Implementation of a March 10 deal on integrating the Kurds' semi-autonomous civil and military institutions into the state has been held up by differences between the parties.

"We are now discussing the mechanisms for implementation" of the deal, Sharaa said.

2. [Finlight] Want more productivity, Rachel Reeves? It‚Äôs time to embrace Mancunian swagger | Richard Partington

Over the summer Rachel Reeves has been on a road trip around Britain. From Cornwall and Kent, to Aberdeen, south Wales and Belfast, in search of the solutions for a national economy that is stuck in a rut.

Inspired by this tour, the chancellor used a Guardian article last week to set her autumn budget priority: boosting productivity. Tax and spending may dominate news headlines, but this is the real problem facing the country, and no politician of the past two decades has managed to fix it.

Productivity is a dull word of vital importance. Growing the measure of output for each hour of work is an economic secret sauce, enabling growth in wages and living standards over the long-run without stoking inflation.

On the hunt for solutions, Reeves could have extended her trip. Leaving Westminster on a (most probably delayed) Avanti train from Euston, or an overcrowded TransPennine Express from her Leeds constituency; for the wetter side of northern England, where Manchester is having a moment in the sun.

Unlike the rest of Britain, there are signs of life in Greater Manchester‚Äôs productivity. Between 2004 and 2023, the city region recorded the highest rise in gross value added for each hour worked of any combined authority in the country.

London ‚Äì once the driver of UK growth ‚Äì has effectively stalled. The capital is still streets ahead in terms of productivity and the UK is still one of the most regionally unequal countries in Europe, with no regions outside London and the south-east of England above the national average. But Manchester is beginning to close the gap ‚Äì with growth of 31% since 2004.

To anyone familiar with the north-west, this will probably come as no surprise. Manchester has changed beyond all recognition in recent years, never mind the past two decades. The Ha√ßienda has been a posh block of flats for longer than it was at the epicentre of the ‚ÄúMadchester‚Äù music scene. The class of ‚Äò92 swapped Old Trafford for building luxury hotels long ago, petrodollar cash has flooded the east of the city, and Oasis have just added, by some counts, ¬£1bn to the British economy at large.

‚ÄúManchester has got this buzz about it,‚Äù says Jim O‚ÄôNeill, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist, and a proud Mancunian, who now chairs the Northern Powerhouse Partnership.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always been there for years in the [city] centre. But most importantly it‚Äôs now spreading. Some would say it‚Äôs that Manchester swagger. It all relates to an attitude that ‚Äòwe can do this; we want to see it happen‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know another part of the country where it has that vibe.‚Äù

For years Britain‚Äôs productivity growth has been a dismal disappointment. Before the 2008 financial crisis growth averaged 2% a year, but has trickled to well below 1% since. Figures last week showed growth contracted in the year to June.

With the autumn budget not far off, this is fuelling a sense of alarm in the Treasury. Whitehall is abuzz with speculation that the Office for Budget Responsibility is poised to hand Reeves downgraded productivity forecasts ‚Äì with the potential to blow a ¬£20bn hole in her tax and spending plans.

To turn things around, Reeves could take the ingredients behind Manchester‚Äôs renaissance and apply them elsewhere. She could also double down on the ‚ÄúNorthern Powerhouse‚Äù strategy for good measure.

Sources close to Labour say that is exactly the plan: Keir Starmer and Reeves are expected to launch an intensified regional growth strategy next month, with the revival of the Northern Powerhouse Rail project as its centrepiece.

Those who know Manchester best say there are a few golden threads to the renaissance of Cottonopolis: devolution; political stability and coordination between its policymakers, businesses and institutions; the involvement of its top universities; and sustained investment.

Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, says London hasn‚Äôt entirely cottoned on. The city symbolised by the worker bee has done well, but could have done even more with extra money and power from the Treasury.

‚ÄúThe learning for Whitehall is, if you want productivity growth, and growth more broadly, you have to let go and trust places. And you have to invest. Because you can‚Äôt get it without investment.

‚Äú[But] there is a bias against cities outside London and the south, and as long as this remains, the country will not achieve its full potential.‚Äù

‚ÄúI compare Manchester [today] with the city I came back to after uni, and the one I had to leave to get on in life. It‚Äôs been a major shift. The momentum is there now, and it‚Äôs what you do with that next.‚Äù

In truth the Manchester revival has deep roots. The timeline before Burnham‚Äôs arrival as mayor in 2017 is well known: the 1996 IRA bomb as catalyst for city centre regeneration; the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the opening of Salford Media City, the Lowry, Bridgewater Hall and the expansion of the Metrolink.

Led by the city council‚Äôs former chief executive, Howard Bernstein, and leader, Richard Leese, their ‚ÄúManchester family‚Äù approach to coordinating investment proves Reeves‚Äôs theory that public money can ‚Äúcrowd in‚Äù the private sector : Manchester has ranked top outside London for foreign direct investment projects for three of the past five years.

However, the transformation isn‚Äôt all plain sailing. House prices and rents are rocketing, crowding out families from Manchester‚Äôs poorer suburbs. For those who, like me, grew up around these parts, the skyscraper-sprouting skyline is a source of both pride, but also nagging worry. Could the pace of change sweep away something special, in a city used to doing things differently? And are the proceeds of growth lining Mancunian pockets, or flowing out of the Irwell to an offshore bank account?

Burnham is alive to the danger. ‚ÄúI use the phrase that, the kids can see the skyscrapers from their bedroom window but they currently don‚Äôt see a path to the modern Greater Manchester economy. The next phase is about making that path.‚Äù

Still, the addition of glass-fronted flats and office blocks among the converted Victorian mills has helped Manchester to create more jobs at a faster pace than the UK average. They reflect Labour‚Äôs hopes for Britain more broadly: that a fairer distribution of growth, in theory, will become easier if there is some growth in the first place.

Reeves could do with a few more Mancunian economic miracles. The national economy will not come unstuck without Britain‚Äôs biggest regional cities reaching their full productive potential.

In her first conference speech as chancellor last year, along the M62 in Liverpool, Reeves promised a Labour government would mean ‚Äúshovels in the ground. Cranes in the sky. The sounds and the sights of the future arriving.‚Äù

To the next critic who asks when exactly that will come about, a Manchester reference may help.


3. [Finlight] Rayner says Farage ‚Äòfailing young women‚Äô with plan to scrap Online Safety Act

Nigel Farage is ‚Äúfailing a generation of young women‚Äù with his plans to scrap the Online Safety Act, Angela Rayner has said, arguing the move would cause an increase in the prevalence of ‚Äúrevenge porn‚Äù.

The comments by the deputy prime minister are the latest criticism of Farage from the government, with Labour launching a parallel series of attack adverts on the Reform UK leader, including one showing him alongside the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate.

In a press conference at the end of last month, Reform promised to scrap the act, which had just come into force, saying measures intended to push social media companies to limit false and potentially harmful content would instead bring censorship and make the UK ‚Äúa borderline dystopian state‚Äù.

In response, the science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, accused Farage of being on the side of child abusers such as Jimmy Savile, bringing a furious response from the Reform leader.

In comments to the Sunday Telegraph, Rayner highlighted what she said would be the risks of getting rid of the act in terms of clamping down on what is formally known as intimate image abuse, where offenders either upload intimate pictures or footage of others or else share them via other means.

‚ÄúIntimate image abuse is a devastating crime and contributes to a vile misogynistic culture on social media that we know translates into physical spaces too,‚Äù Rayner told the paper.

‚ÄúNigel Farage risks failing a generation of young women with his dangerous and irresponsible plans to scrap online safety laws. Scrapping safeguards and having no viable alternative plan in place to halt the floodgates of abuse that could open is an appalling dereliction of duty.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Farage to tell women and girls across Britain how he would keep them safe online.‚Äù

Labour is launching a linked series of online adverts against Farage, including one published on Sunday morning connected to Rayner‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúNigel Farage wants to make it easier to share revenge porn online,‚Äù it says, alongside an image of Farage grinning.

According to the Sunday Times, another advert will highlight Farage‚Äôs comments about Tate, the influencer who, along with his brother, Tristan, faces charges in the UK including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking.

The two British Americans are under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges that they deny.

The Labour advert shows Farage with Andrew Tate and the headline: ‚ÄúNigel Farage says Andrew Tate is an ‚Äòimportant voice‚Äô for men.‚Äù The comments come from an interview Farage did on the Strike It Big podcast last year.

Laila Cunningham, a former magistrate who has joined Reform, wrote a Telegraph article on Saturday in which she called the Online Safety Act ‚Äúcensorship laws‚Äù, saying laws already existed to combat ‚Äùrevenge porn‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cover for censorship, and an excuse to hand unelected regulators sweeping powers to silence views they don‚Äôt like, while doing nothing about the real crimes happening on our streets,‚Äù she wrote.

Cunningham said minister should instead focus on detaining asylum seekers rather than putting them in hotels, saying that for now, women ‚Äúare being put in harm‚Äôs way‚Äù as the asylum seekers could pose a risk to them.

6. [Finlight] Will Trump‚Äôs tariffs get ‚Äôtariffried‚Äô by the courts?

Investing.com --¬†The Trump administration is bracing for a potential legal setback that could undermine its tariff strategy, analysts at Yardeni Research highlighted in a note this week.¬†
The firm stated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., may soon rule that President Donald Trump lacks the legal authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
Yardeni noted that concern was evident in an August 11 letter from two of the administration‚Äôs top lawyers to the court clerk, filed after oral arguments on July 31, where judges reportedly pressed the government on the tariffs‚Äô legality.¬†
The letter warns that ‚Äúsuddenly revoking the President‚Äôs tariff authority under IEEPA would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,‚Äù adding it could ‚Äúlead to a 1929-style result.‚Äù
While Yardeni said the conclusion ‚Äúmay be exaggerated,‚Äù the fallout would still be ‚Äúmessy,‚Äù with foreign governments potentially ignoring trade agreements and companies seeking tariff refunds from the Treasury.
Trump has promoted tariffs as an ‚ÄúExternal Revenue Service‚Äù to help cut the federal deficit.¬†
Customs duties hit a record $157 billion over the 12 months through July, and Trump has aimed for a base tariff of 10%-15% on all U.S. trading partners, potentially yielding over $500 billion annually.
Losing the case could raise bond yields and pressure stocks due to renewed policy uncertainty, according to Yardeni.
The firm cited Capital Alpha Partners‚Äô Jim Lucier, who expects a Federal Circuit decision by late August or September.
¬†A unanimous ruling against the administration could give the Supreme Court cover to avoid the case and decline a stay that would keep the tariffs in place.


7. [Finlight] Wells Fargo outlines how the Fed may revisit its policy framework at Jackson Hole

Investing.com -¬†Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to go over how the U.S. economy and the central bank‚Äôs policy setting has evolved over the course of his tenure at a closely-watched event in Wyoming later this month, according to analysts at Wells Fargo.
Powell previously used his address at the annual Jackson Hole symposium in 2020 to lay out changes to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs policy framework. Some five years later, that outline is now set to reach its conclusion.
In a note, the Wells Fargo analysts led by Sarah House noted that in the decade leading up to the FOMC‚Äôs prior framework review, the economic environment was dominated by persistently low inflation and excess labor market slack. The Fed has been tasked with using its policies options to keep inflation stable and securing maximum employment.¬†
"The adjustments made in 2020 at the height of the pandemic reflected these perceived asymmetric risks to the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate," the analysts wrote.
However, in the time since then, the macroeconomic backdrop has changed drastically. Powered by pandemic-era shocks, inflation charged past 2% in March 2021 and has not returned to that rate -- the Fed‚Äôs target level -- since. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to less than 4% by the end of that same year. It now stands at 4.2%.
"Much of the past few years have been marked by U.S. monetary policymakers facing an old but new problem: overheated labor markets and above-target inflation," the analysts wrote.
Against this backdrop, they do not anticipate that the Fed will unveil any major changes to its toolkit as part of this year‚Äôs review, with the key federal funds rate likely to stay the main device the central bank can utilize to respond to broader trends in employment and inflation.
The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet may also be "de-emphasized" as a policy tool "for the time being," they added. Powell is anticipated to review how the FOMC approaches policy communication later this year as well.
Generally, the strategists said the new framework will likely "codify" what is already the Fed‚Äôs "modus operandi" -- a more "symmetric" approach to its inflation and employment objectives.
"Yet, the shift away from the asymmetric risks around low inflation and maximum employment marks an important departure from the psychology of the 2008-2020 period, and it could result in more preemptive policy tightening when the next inflationary episode occurs," they said.

9. [Finlight] UAE: What are Certificates of Origin and how Abu Dhabi‚Äôs 10.3% rise proves a shift from oil dependence

Certificates of Origin certify that goods are produced in a specific country, essential for customs, tariffs, and export compliance/ Image: File

Certificates of Origin: Their role and relevance

Growth in COO issuance reflects rising export momentum





Strategic implications for Abu Dhabi‚Äôs economy

Institutional role of the Abu Dhabi Chamber





The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported a significant increase in the issuance of Certificates of Origin over the past year. This development highlights the emirate‚Äôs growing industrial base, increased trade activity, and a steadily advancing economic diversification strategy aimed at reducing dependence on oil exports.A Certificate of Origin (COO) serves as an official document confirming that the goods in a shipment are wholly obtained, produced, manufactured, or processed in a specific country. These certificates are vital tools in international trade, helping businesses clear customs, determine applicable tariffs, and comply with import regulations in target markets.In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, a valid COO is often mandatory for both exports and imports. Without it, companies risk facing shipment delays, regulatory penalties, or outright rejection of goods. In this context, chambers of commerce, such as the one in Abu Dhabi, play a central role, acting as accredited bodies authorised to issue these certificates.Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Abu Dhabi Chamber recorded a 10.3 percent increase in the number of COOs issued. This growth signals a wider and more active base of local exporters, as well as heightened economic activity across non-oil sectors.The Chamber attributes this uptick to Abu Dhabi‚Äôs expanding industrial capacity and its growing reputation as a key regional player in trade and investment.Sectorally, the bulk of these COOs were issued to businesses involved in chemicals, metals, and engineering ‚Äî all areas that point to a robust and diversified manufacturing ecosystem. Notably, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have shown increased participation in export activities, driven by support mechanisms provided by the Chamber. These include specialised training programs, business matchmaking efforts, and collaboration with regional and international trade entities.The broader export landscape also aligns with these trends. During the first half of 2025, Abu Dhabi‚Äôs non-oil foreign trade surged by 34.7 percent. Within that, non-oil exports leapt by 64 percent, re-exports grew by 35 percent, and imports rose by 15 percent. These figures build on the previous year‚Äôs performance, which also saw strong growth: non-oil trade rose by 9 percent, exports increased by 16 percent, and imports by 3 percent.The increasing number of Certificates of Origin being issued by the Abu Dhabi Chamber is seen by its leadership as a strong indicator of export sector vitality and a reflection of the emirate‚Äôs deepening integration with global trade networks. Shamis Al Dhaheri, Second Vice Chairman and Managing Director of the Chamber, considers this sustained rise as clear proof of the competitiveness of Abu Dhabi-based companies and their growing capacity to enter and thrive in international markets.Al Dhaheri has attributed this momentum not only to market confidence in locally produced goods but also to the Chamber‚Äôs continued investment in supporting export-ready businesses. He noted that Abu Dhabi companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, are increasingly leveraging the Chamber‚Äôs services, including export training, market access programs, and strategic trade partnerships, to expand their global footprint.He also emphasized that the Chamber is focused on enabling exporters to benefit from customs advantages provided by bilateral and multilateral agreements. With COOs validating the national origin of goods, UAE products are better positioned to benefit from preferential trade terms, giving them a more competitive edge in international markets.According to him, the Chamber views Certificates of Origin as more than just administrative tools; they are gateways to new economic opportunities. He pointed to the Chamber‚Äôs ongoing efforts to enhance its digital infrastructure and to advocate for the private sector as part of a broader strategy to make Abu Dhabi‚Äôs economy more resilient and globally connected.Al Dhaheri underlined that the current indicators affirm not just the strength of the Chamber‚Äôs services, but also the private sector‚Äôs rising contribution to national economic goals. The increase in export activity, particularly among SMEs, is seen as a tangible outcome of the emirate‚Äôs diversification agenda and its efforts to reduce dependency on oil revenues.Founded in 1969 by an Emiri decree issued by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established to promote and protect the interests of businesses operating in the emirate. Over the decades, it has evolved into a central platform for dialogue between the private sector and the government, supporting enterprise development across sectors.The Chamber hosts frequent trade delegations, policy discussions, and cross-border business forums. These activities help reinforce Abu Dhabi‚Äôs global standing and attract foreign direct investment. Recognised by the leadership and business community alike, the Chamber‚Äôs programs serve as key enablers of the emirate‚Äôs economic ambitions.In line with this mission, the Chamber continues to invest in improving its digital infrastructure and expanding its export-related services. It views the recent growth in COOs not just as a positive trade indicator, but as a sign of resilience, adaptability, and growing maturity within Abu Dhabi‚Äôs private sector.


10. [Finlight] The Alaska summit was a spectacular distraction

Trump needed a break from the infighting in MAGA so he decided an inconsequential meeting with Putin would do the trick.

Say you are the president of the United States and the relationship with a significant chunk of your political base has become less than blissfully harmonious. What do you do?

Well, one option is to stage a summit, accompanied by much fanfare, with the president of Russia, ostensibly in order to end that country‚Äôs war in Ukraine.

And this is precisely the manoeuvre that was pulled by US President Donald Trump, who on Friday rolled out the red carpet in Alaska for his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The short-lived encounter was ultimately anticlimactic, with Trump offering the incisive assessment that ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no deal until there‚Äôs a deal.‚Äù

Fox News reported that Trump had rated the much-anticipated meeting with Putin a ‚Äú10‚Äù out of 10 and that he particularly ‚Äúappreciated the Russian president‚Äôs comments when he claimed he would not have invaded Ukraine had Trump won the 2020 presidency‚Äù.

Fox went on to add that neither head of state had bothered to specify the ‚Äúreasoning behind these comments‚Äù.

At any rate, the no-deal talks constituted a convenient distraction from current intra-MAGA strife, which owes to a couple of factors. There is, for example, the matter of the files relating to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019.

When US Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Trump in May on the Justice Department‚Äôs review of the content of the so-called ‚ÄúEpstein files‚Äù, she reportedly informed the president that his name appeared therein.

Despite having pledged while on the campaign trail to declassify the Epstein files, Trump changed tack earlier this year and angrily dismissed the investigation as a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù. He went as far as to insult many of his Republican followers as ‚Äústupid‚Äù and ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù for continuing to insist that the Epstein details be released.

On July 12, the president took to social media with his signature preference for manic capitalisation to berate those demanding declassification: ‚ÄúWe have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‚Äòselfish people‚Äô are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein.‚Äù

And yet this is not the only headache facing the ‚ÄúPERFECT Administration‚Äù from within Trump‚Äôs own MAGA base, many of whose prominent members have become vocally critical of Israel‚Äôs genocide in the Gaza Strip, which Trump persists in aiding and abetting.

The genocide, which will mark its two-year anniversary in October, has officially killed nearly 62,000 Palestinians thus far ‚Äì although the true death toll is undoubtedly many times higher. Apparently, Israel‚Äôs behaviour was entirely palatable to much of the US political establishment when it simply consisted of unending massacres, slaughtered and mutilated babies, bombed hospitals, and razed neighbourhoods.

Now that mass starvation has been visibly added to the genocidal mix, however, Israel seems to have crossed a red line even among formerly staunch devotees. As per Gaza‚Äôs Ministry of Health, the death toll from malnutrition has hit 251, including 108 children. Images of skeletal Palestinians have flooded the internet, and the United Nations World Food Programme has categorised food shortage in Gaza as ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù.

Furthermore, according to the UN, the Israeli military has killed at least 1,760 Palestinians since late May alone, as they sought aid, including at sites run by the nefarious so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Backed by the US and Israel, the GHF has not only served Israel‚Äôs plans for mass displacement and forced eviction of Palestinians; the aid distribution hubs have also functioned as a sort of one-stop shop for indiscriminate killing ‚Äì which, after all, is the whole point of genocide.

And while Trump has intermittently chided Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the disagreeable optics of the whole spectacle, it has not been sufficient to appease the scrutiny of the likes of right-wing US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a traditional ally of the president known for such antics as wearing a hat imprinted with the words ‚ÄúTrump Was Right About Everything!‚Äù

Advertisement

In a social media post last month, Greene ‚Äì a leading figure in Trump‚Äôs MAGA movement ‚Äì was unexpectedly explicit in her condemnation of ‚Äúthe genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza‚Äù. Other MAGA fixtures like far-right influencer Laura Loomer ‚Äì a self-defined ‚Äúproud Islamophobe‚Äù and general bona fide sociopath ‚Äì wasted no time in responding to Greene‚Äôs post: ‚ÄúThere is no genocide in Gaza.‚Äù

Anyway, political tensions and infighting were at least temporarily removed from the spotlight by the Trump-Putin extravaganza in Alaska. It‚Äôs hardly the first time the old art of distraction has come in handy ‚Äì Trump‚Äôs pal, Netanyahu, is the master of this trade. His commitment to waging genocide in Gaza has more than a little to do with his desire to stave off domestic opposition and avoid dealing with the assorted corruption charges in which he is presently embroiled.

And while the Alaskan red-carpet stunt provided little to write home about, distraction may yet prevail as folks ponder what the hell that was all about.

üíª TECHNOLOGY HIGHLIGHTS
----------------------------------------

1. Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems - SiliconANGLE

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.


5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.
