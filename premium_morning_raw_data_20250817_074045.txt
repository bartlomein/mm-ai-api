1. Ammonnews : Government papers found in Alaskan hotel at Trump-Putin summit

Ammon News - A dossier containing details about timings and locations for the Alaska summit was reportedly found by hotel guests on a printer hours before Donald Trump greeted Vladimir Putin.

The papers, which appeared to have been prepared by US state department staff, included potentially sensitive information about the high-stakes talks.

The eight-page document was found at around 9am on Friday by three guests at Hotel Captain Cook, located around 20 minutes from the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson base in Anchorage, according to NPR.

The document included details of the Aug 15 schedule, including specific names of the rooms inside the Anchorage base where each meeting would take place.

A seating plan as well as information about Mr Trump planning to give Putin a ceremonial present of an "American Bald Eagle Desk Statue" were also included in the documents, the outlet reported.

The document states it was produced by the Office of the Chief of Protocol. It is not known who left the schedule on the printer, but Mr Trump's protocol chief is Monica Crowley, a former Fox News analyst.

The papers reportedly list the names and phone numbers of three US staff members as well as the names of 13 US and Russian state leaders.

It also included phonetic pointers for how to pronounce the names of the Russians expected at the summit, including "Mr President POO-tihn".

The dossier also contained details about Friday's planned luncheon, which did not go ahead.

According to the document, the two world leaders would have sat opposite one another, flanked by their respective delegations.

Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, was supposed to sit next to Mr Trump, on his right, with Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff.

Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, and special envoy Steve Witkoff would have sat to Mr Trump's left.

Anna Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary, denied that leaving the papers, which she described as a "multi-age lunch menu", in public did not amount to a security breach.

Tommy Pigott, the principal deputy spokesman for the state department, told The Telegraph: "Instead of covering the historic steps towards peace achieved at Friday's summit, NPR is trying to make a story out of a lunch menu. Ridiculous." The Telegraph


2. 3 Fantastic Growth Stocks to Buy in August | The Motley Fool

Only one of these growth stocks is up big so far in 2025. But all three could be huge winners over the next few years.

We're well into the home stretch of 2025. August is more than halfway over. But there's still plenty of time remaining in the year -- and in this month -- to invest in stocks that hold the potential to deliver tremendous returns.

Three Motley Fool contributors think they've found fantastic growth stocks to buy in August. Here's why they picked Eli Lilly (LLY 2.73%), Summit Therapeutics (SMMT 0.83%), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.66%).

David Jagielski (Eli Lilly): Shares of Eli Lilly went into a tailspin earlier this month, after the company reported its latest earnings numbers. Despite news of the company generating fantastic growth due to the success of its GLP-1 drugs and plenty of more growth on the horizon, there's been a flurry of bearishness surrounding the stock this year. Shares of Eli Lilly are down around 19% since the start of the year (as of Aug. 8).

The healthcare company has grown its sales by an impressive rate of 41% through the first six months of the year, with revenue totaling more than $28 billion (which is around as much as the company reported in revenue for all of 2022).

However, it was underwhelming news around its weight loss pill, orforglipron, that appeared to provide investors with a reason to sell. The pill helped people lose close to 12% of their weight in a late-stage trial, but that was short of the 15% which analysts were hoping to see. With expectations high for Eli Lilly to be a clear market leader in the weight loss space, investors appear unwilling to accept anything outside of sheer dominance.

But buying Eli Lilly on weakness makes for an intriguing opportunity, especially if you're a long-term investor. Given its robust operations, highly successful GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, and loads more products in development, I firmly believe this is going to be the first healthcare stock to hit a market cap of $1 trillion in the future. Entering this week, its market value was around $560 billion; this is a stock that could have tremendous runway.

Although the recent news around orforglipron may be disappointing, Eli Lilly's business still looks incredible, and buying the pharma stock right now could make for a fantastic opportunity in the long run.

Keith Speights (Summit Therapeutics): Unlike Eli Lilly, Summit Therapeutics doesn't generate billions of dollars in revenue. It doesn't even have an approved product on the market. However, I think you can stick a bold "yet" at the end of both of those previous statements. Summit is an up-and-coming drugmaker that's about to hit its stride, in my view.

What's behind my optimistic outlook? Less than three months ago, Summit announced positive top-line results from its first global phase 3 clinical study evaluating ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The combo therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by a whopping 48% compared to chemotherapy alone.

Based on the results of this clinical trial, Summit plans to file a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of ivonescimab plus chemotherapy as a second-line NSCLC treatment. There's no guarantee of FDA approval. However, the fact that there aren't any current FDA-approved therapies that have demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival benefit in this indication gives investors more reason to hope for success.

Should Summit win this FDA approval, though, it could be only the tip of the iceberg. The company is also conducting phase 3 trials evaluating ivonesimab with chemotherapy as a first-line NSCLC treatment and as a monotherapy in treating metastatic NSCLC patients with high PD-L1 expression. Should these studies go well (and I suspect they will), I predict that Summit could earn a spot among the greatest cancer-treating stocks of the 21st century.

Prosper Junior Bakiny (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): It's been a challenging year for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a leading biotech company. The drugmaker has encountered several issues, and most recently, its shares plummeted following a clinical setback related to VX-993, an investigational therapy for acute pain. VX-993 failed to meet its primary endpoint in a phase 2 clinical trial.

Vertex's shares are down 2% this year, while the S&P 500 is up 8%. For investors focused on the long game, now might be a great time to buy. Vertex Pharmaceuticals delivers consistent revenue and earnings, and has an expanding product lineup, a deep pipeline, and a proven culture of innovation.

In the second quarter, the company's revenue jumped by 12% year over year -- a strong performance for a biotech giant -- to $2.96 billion.

The company's long-standing cystic fibrosis franchise is still performing well. That should continue long enough for Vertex's newer products, including Casgevy, which treats a pair of rare blood diseases, and Journavx for acute pain, to start making meaningful contributions to its top line. Both could hit blockbuster status eventually.

And by then, Vertex should be able to launch even newer medicines. The company's investigational therapy for type 1 diabetes, zimislecel, is performing well in clinical trials and could receive approval within the next two years.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals should continue to innovate long after, given the several products across its late-stage and mid-stage pipeline. All these factors make Vertex's prospects attractive. The company's shares might be down right now, but at current levels, they could deliver superior returns over the next five years. That's what makes the stock so attractive right now.


3. European leaders to join Zelensky when he meets Trump at the White House

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Finnish president Alexander Stubb were the first leaders to confirm they will join Mr Zelensky in Washington DC.

French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, and Nato chief Mark Rutte have also confirmed their attendance.

Downing Street would not comment on whether Sir Keir Starmer plans to travel to Washington to join other European leaders on Monday.

Mr Zelensky's Oval Office rendezvous with the US president will take place after Western allies meet for a coalition of the willing video call on Sunday afternoon.

The call will be hosted by Prime Minister Sir Keir, France's Mr Macron and Germany's Mr Merz.

The show of unity by European leaders comes as Mr Trump appears poised to urge the Ukrainian leader to agree to a Russian land grab of his country's territory, according to reports.

Several news outlets have reported Russian president Vladimir Putin has demanded full control of Donetsk and Luhansk - two occupied Ukrainian regions - as a condition for ending the war.

In exchange, he would give up other Ukrainian territories held by Russian troops, multiple reports said, attributing sources familiar with Mr Putin and Mr Trump's negotiations in Alaska on Friday.

Mr Trump is said to be inclined to support the plan, and will speak to Mr Zelensky about it when they meet in the Oval Office.

The European leaders may also fear a repeat of Mr Zelensky's last visit to the White House at the end of February.

The tumultuous spat resulted in a souring of relations between the US and Ukraine, including a temporary cut off of American aid for the war effort.

Mr Trump appeared to change his position on how to end the war in Ukraine following his meeting with the Russian president on Friday.

Following the Alaska summit, the American leader suggested he wants to move straight to a full peace deal, rather than negotiating a ceasefire first.

The shift appears to echo the Russians' refusal to agree to ceasefire before engaging in peace talks.

Writing on social media on Sunday morning, the Ukrainian leader railed against Russia's refusal to lay down arms temporarily before agreeing to end the war.

Mr Zelensky said: "We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing.

"This complicates the situation."

He added: "If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater - peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades.

"But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war."

Mr Zelensky is expected to attend Sunday afternoon's video call with leaders from the coalition of the willing, which is scheduled to take place at 2pm UK time.


4. Train Accident: DC Leads Rescue, Relief Operation - UrduPoint

LODHRAN, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 17th Aug, 2025) The district administration launched an immediate relief and rescue operation following a train accident involving the Awam Express, traveling from Peshawar to Karachi, which occurred near Lodhran Junction.

Upon receiving information about the incident, Deputy Commissioner Dr. Lubna Nazir promptly visited the accident site and personally supervised the rescue efforts. She was accompanied by Assistant Commissioner Iram Shehzadi. The Deputy Commissioner issued urgent directives to the District Emergency Officer and closely monitored the ongoing rescue activities to ensure timely assistance to the victims.

As part of her continued response, Dr. Lubna Nazir later visited the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Lodhran, where she inquired about the condition of the injured passengers and reviewed the medical care being provided.

She instructed the hospital administration to ensure priority medical treatment and full support to all those injured in the incident.

According to Rescue 1122 officials, four bogies of the Awam Express derailed near Lodhran Junction. Rescue teams provided first aid to 11 passengers at the scene, while 22 others were shifted to DHQ Hospital for further treatment. Unfortunately, one passenger succumbed to injuries.

The timely response by the district administration and emergency services played a crucial role in managing the situation and minimizing further loss.


5. Ammonnews : France calls on Israel to abandon the E1 colonial project

Ammon News - The French Foreign Ministry called on Israel to abandon the E1 project, which aims to expand settlements seized from Palestinian citizens in East Jerusalem.

In a statement, the French Foreign Ministry condemned the Israeli settlement plan in the E1 area, which would separate Jerusalem from the West Bank.

The statement called on Israel to abandon this project, which constitutes a serious violation of international law.

It warned that its implementation would divide the West Bank in two and seriously undermine the two-state solution.

The statement stressed that the two-state solution is the only solution that guarantees lasting peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians. WAFA

7. Barcelona receive Robert Lewandowski injury boost ahead of Levante fixture

Barcelona managed to defeat Mallorca with relative ease in their La Liga opener on Saturday, despite the absence of Robert Lewandowski. The Polish striker picked up an injury prior to last weekend's Joan Gamper Trophy, which meant that he would be out for the start of the 2025-26 campaign.

It has been reported that Lewandowski will miss matches against Mallorca and Levante, while he would be touch-and-go for Barcelona's MD3 clash against Rayo Vallecano. However, the Catalans have now been handed good news with the latest report of the veteran's injury situation.

As per Diario AS, it is almost certain that Lewandowski will be available to face Levante next weekend. His recovery is being more positive than initially expected by the medical services, so if there are no setbacks, the Polish striker will be available to make the trip to the Valencian region.

The current plan is for Lewandowski to return to group training at the beginning of next week, and he will receive the medical green light from Barcelona's staff on Friday. With the Levante match on Saturday, it means that he will be available to Hansi Flick.

Lewandowski, who scored 42 goals in all competitions last season, is still Barcelona's starting striker, although he will find it difficult to keep Ferran Torres at bay. The latter scored in the victory at Mallorca, and in doing so, he continued the fine form that he has shown over the last 12 months.

Flick will be delighted at the competition for places he has, especially in attacking areas. Lewandowski, Ferran and Marcus Rashford are three very good options for the number nine position, and if they are all firing, the Catalans will be tough to pin down - as was the case last season.


8. Sunday's letters State officials don't even pretend to care about our schools

They don't care

With all the mismanagement and crisis affecting our local public schools, I'm outraged that many of our state-level elected officials can't be bothered to even pretend to care and that our state legislature can't be bothered to do anything to help.

They must be too busy sending more of the money to private schools that don't need it instead.

In the meantime, our students and public school employees are forced to bear the cost of this mismanagement and apathy that they had nothing to do with creating.

They all should go

The news regarding the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools' debt seems to get worse every time we read about it. I fail to see how it is even possible that the school board did not sense that something was wrong. The numbers are just too big.

It would seem that many more individuals other than the superintendent and the chief financial officer should have known about this gross miscarriage of office. This would include the school board and the many administrative assistants at the Central Office. How is it that no one voiced the questions that certainly must have been apparent? It appears that no one wanted to take responsibility.

We have elected the school board to represent us and help manage and oversee the school system. Funding is one of, if not the major issue that must come up often at meetings.

The school board as the head of the system should bear the responsibility. They have let us down. They have attended meetings, collected their payments and ignored the critical duty of overseeing funding.

It would seem to be only fair that the school board members should resign and return all payments collected. Also, since it might be argued that they may have a fiduciary duty to protect the system and they did not, why would they not be held legally responsible?

Death and taxes

What happened to Forsyth County/Winston-Salem?

I have lived in the Forsyth County area since 1982. I retired a year and a half ago and guess I'm considered a senior, although I don't feel like one.

I have paid property taxes every year and have lived in a modest home in Clemmons for 22 years. I was just hit with an almost $3,000 tax bill, which is unbelievable. I know my neighbors are likely paying more.

President Trump has mentioned people over 65 not having to pay property taxes. The governor of Florida is proposing a $1,000 benefit to help seniors pay their property taxes. We need a local or state representative to propose a change for North Carolina seniors. I don't care if they say the cutoff is at 68, just give some kind of benefit for fixed-income people to look forward to.

They say the only two things certain in life are death and taxes. I now understand this better because you get taxed until you die.

For years, I voted for school bond issues because I believed it helped our local school system and was good for the students. Now the school system is looking for $50 million from somewhere. Somebody knows what happened to the money and I hope this is thoroughly investigated.

I feel for the possible 350 dedicated teachers and staff who may lose their job through no fault of their own. What happened?

It is embarrassing when someone asks me about the problems in our school system because no one has the answer. Between high property taxes and a broken school system, people are not going to want to move to this area.

Once again, what happened?

David Steinbeck

Winston-Salem

Explain yourselves

Dear Sens. Tillis and Budd, Rep. Harrigan and state Sen. Berger:

The enthusiasm for guns is prominent in Washington and in the North Carolina legislature. Could you folks, or one of your staffers, explain how guns are beneficial to North Carolinians and other Americans?

Please include reasons why the public should feel safe shopping at big-box stores, malls and pharmacies.

Please include reasons why children should feel safe in their schools.

Please include reasons why churchgoers should feel safe while they are worshiping.

And please explain exactly which well-regulated militia gun carriers represent.

Thank you for your attention to my request.

Mary Jo Whitley

Pfafftown

Here's the solution

I think the solution for the Ukraine war should be that Vladimir Putin is arrested and put on trial in the World Court for mass murder and Russia pays for reconstruction in Ukraine.

9. Air Canada to resume flights after government directive ending strike

Air Canada plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) acted on a directive from the country's Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu to end a cabin crew strike that caused the suspension of around 700 daily flights.

The CIRB directed Air Canada to resume operations and for all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flight attendants to return to their duties by 2pm ET (1800 GMT), the airline said in a statement.

The directive came after the government on Saturday moved to end the strike and require binding arbitration to break a contract impasse, an action that the country's largest carrier had sought but unionized flight attendants fiercely opposed.

Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.

Thousands of Air Canada cabin crew walked off the job on Saturday for the first time since 1985, after months of negotiations over a new contract. In anticipation of the stoppage, the airline began cancelling flights on Friday, forcing more than 100,000 travellers to scramble for alternatives or stay put.

Air Canada said flights would restart on Sunday evening, but some would still be cancelled over the next 7-10 days as the schedule stabilises and returns to normal.


10. Ammonnews : 8 dead, 4 missing in north China flash flood

Ammon News - A flash flood in Inner Mongolia killed eight people and left four missing, Chinese state media said Sunday.

A group of 13 people were camping outdoors in Inner Mongolia's Urat Rear Banner when a flash flood occurred around 10 pm (1400 GMT) on Saturday, state news agency Xinhua said.

As of Sunday morning, one person had been rescued and search and rescue operations for the missing are ongoing, Xinhua added.


11. NDMA Warns Of Intensified Monsoon Spells; Says Relief, Restoration Efforts Underway - UrduPoint

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 17th Aug, 2025) Chairman National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Lieutenant General Inam Haider on Sunday warned that two to three additional monsoon spells are likely in the coming weeks, with rainfall intensity projected to surge 50 to 60 percent above previous years.

Addressing a media briefing on rain-related damages and flood response, the NDMA chief said this year's monsoon spread has expanded significantly due to unusually high summer temperatures, which triggered atmospheric instability and heavier rainfall across multiple regions.

He attributed the heightened severity to climate change, which continues to intensify weather disruptions in vulnerable regions. Pakistan is witnessing severe repercussions, with widespread destruction reported in Buner, Bajaur and Battagram areas increasingly exposed to climate-driven hazards.

"The monsoon season is expected to persist until September 10," he said.

Lieutenant General Haider said land connectivity has been severed with several settlements in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to flash floods and landslides. Search operations for missing persons are ongoing, while relief goods and food supplies are being dispatched to affected districts.

Restoration work is underway in areas where link roads have been damaged. NDMA remains in constant coordination with provincial governments to ensure timely assistance and effective response. More relief packages will be delivered on Monday to districts that have suffered the highest loss of life during recent monsoon-related disasters.

The NDMA chairman emphasized that all available resources will be mobilized to minimize potential flood-related losses. Vulnerable areas will be evacuated in advance to safeguard lives, while communication networks in cut-off regions will be restored on a priority basis through technical teams.

Following the monsoon season, NDMA will work closely with the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Housing to rehabilitate damaged infrastructure.

Lt Gen Inam Haider attributed the recent devastation in northern districts to climate change, warning that northern Punjab and northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are likely to experience more intense rainfall in the coming days. He assured that the NDMA, in coordination with relevant ministries, will sustain rehabilitation efforts and issue regular updates to help minimize future losses.

The restoration drive will prioritize reconnecting isolated regions and is expected to be completed before the onset of the next monsoon cycle.

Armed forces are assisting in ongoing relief and rescue operations.

A detailed survey, in coordination with provincial governments, will be conducted to assess exact losses. Relief camps will be established if necessary to provide shelter and support to displaced communities.

Earlier, officials from the NDMA briefed the media on a comprehensive monsoon contingency plan, identifying regions most vulnerable to heavy rainfall and potential flooding. According to the briefing, northeastern areas -- including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- along with southeastern districts such as Tharparkar, Sujawal, Tando Allah Yar, Tando Muhammad Khan, and Badin are likely to experience intensified monsoon activity.

The NDMA highlighted that three major weather systems are currently converging over Pakistan, which is expected to significantly amplify rainfall across the country

NDMA Technical Expert Dr. Tayyab Shah stated that the ongoing rainfall sequence is expected to continue until August 22, with further intensification likely. He added that another monsoon spell will begin after August 22, with three additional rainfall systems approaching the region.

He noted that a new rainfall sequence is approaching from the Bay of Bengal, while another system is advancing from Afghanistan's Nangarhar and Kandahar regions.

NDMA General Manager Zahra Hassan stated that heavy rainfall is expected within the next 24 to 48 hours, warning that Tarbela Dam is currently at 98 percent capacity and may reach a critical level during this period. She further noted that water levels have risen by up to 15 feet at Katarian and Gwalmandi bridges along Nullah Leh.

A new rainfall sequence has commenced in areas along the Koh-e-Suleiman mountain range. Flood risks have escalated in Azad Jammu and Kashmir's Neelum, Poonch, and Bagh districts. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, vulnerable areas include Peshawar, Chitral, Dir, and Charsadda, where flood threats remain particularly high.

Brigadier Kamran, Member Operations at NDMA, stated that preparations for the monsoon season began as early as February 2025, with preventive measures undertaken in coordination with provincial governments to minimize potential damage. However, he noted that the recent devastation in Buner and Bajaur was triggered by sudden cloudbursts.

According to Brigadier Kamran, 337 lives have been lost and 178 individuals injured over the past two days. He stated that the army and Frontier Corps are actively supporting provincial governments with resources for ongoing rescue operations. A second consignment of relief goods from the Federal government is scheduled to be dispatched to Buner on Monday.


12. How UCLA's 'Brotherhood Meetings' Changed the Locker Room

Now that UCLA's two-week stay in Costa Mesa, CA, for fall camp is over, one of the biggest stories out of the camp was DeShaun Foster's "brotherhood meetings," and how they left a last effect on the locker room.

During Saturday's media availability, the second-year head coach explained what the meetings were about and how they went throughout camp.

"Just a way for everybody to get to know the new coaches and my story, and why we are coaching," Foster said. "What my playing 'why?' was. We just went through everything and each coach got up there and was able to just tell their story. I learned a lot of stuff, even from Jerry Neuheisel, some things I didn't know about his football career and everything even though I was here for it.

"It was just awesome to just see guys open up and be vulnerable and let people know, like, you do go through stuff. Everybody's life isn't perfect."

Did Foster see or feel the impact of these meetings?

"Yeah," he answered. "A lot of tears. I just liked that the players were being vulnerable and letting their guard down because they saw the coaches doing it. That really brought us together and we're going to see if it worked."

Bruins kicker Matten Bhaghani revealed the nightly meetings during Wednesday's media availability.

"Coach Fos has done a great job instilling brotherhood in us," the junior kicker said. "We have 'brotherhood meetings' damn near almost every night. Compared to last year, the team is so much closer and you can really talk to anybody. He's reall done a great job getting all the boys meshed together and ready to go."

So, what are these "brotherhood meetings?"

Bhaghani explained, "A 'brotherhood meeting' is, basically, where we'll have one of the coaching staff, every night, give their backstory and what they feel is brotherhood and what is their 'why?' And then we'll break up into little groups and talk about our own 'whys?' and why we play football and kid of just getting to learn about your other teammates."

It's not too common for a team to be off campus during camp, but Foster tapped into his NFL days, where training camp was almost always somewhere else. Bhaghani thinks all of this connection and progression on the field is a result of being off-site.

"Being away from campus is amazing," he said. "It gets rid of all distractions. All you can focus on is football and the day-to-day and just getting better every day. Just learning about your teammates and really developing relationships with them."

13. DC Stresses Public Awareness To Eradicate Polio - UrduPoint

MUZAFFARGARH, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 17th Aug, 2025) Deputy Commissioner Usman Tahir Jappa has emphasized the urgent need to raise public awareness about the importance of administering polio drops to all children under five during every campaign, in order to eliminate the crippling disease from Pakistan.

Chairing a meeting to review preparations for the upcoming anti-polio drive, the DC highlighted the critical role of public cooperation in ensuring the campaign's success. The meeting was attended by Additional Deputy Commissioner General Muhammad Yousuf Cheena, Assistant Commissioner Muzaffargarh Khizar Zahoor, CEO Health Dr. Fayaz Ahmed, and officials from the Health Department and other relevant agencies.

Officials informed the meeting that a four-day anti-polio campaign will be conducted from September 1 to 4 in Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu districts, targeting 848,458 children under five years of age.

A total of 3,639 teams, including 3,472 mobile teams comprising around 8,059 personnel, will be deployed for the campaign.

The DC directed that special vaccination teams be stationed at all entry and exit points of the districts to ensure no child is missed, regardless of movement in or out of the area.

He also underscored the importance of leveraging social media platforms to amplify awareness and reach every household. To enhance community engagement, he urged that religious scholars and public figures be mobilized to deliver messages encouraging families to vaccinate their children.

"Participating in the anti-polio campaign is not just a civic duty, but an act of patriotism," the DC stated.


14. Russia's Terms for Ending Ukraine War Revealed After Trump-Putin Talks - GreekReporter.com

A few days after the high-profile summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the contours of Moscow's latest proposal for ending the war in Ukraine have been revealed.

According to multiple sources cited by Reuters, the plan envisions sweeping concessions from Kyiv in exchange for limited Russian withdrawals, underscoring the stark divide between the Kremlin's demands and Ukraine's stated red lines.

Under the proposal, Russia is insisting on full control of the Donbas region, which includes the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is demanding that Ukrainian forces withdraw entirely from the area.

In return, Russia has indicated that it would pull back its troops from certain occupied zones in the northeastern Sumy and Kharkiv regions and agree to "freeze" the frontlines in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to travel to Washington on Monday, where he will meet with Trump to discuss the emerging framework and its implications for the future of the conflict.

What remains unclear, however, is whether Putin's proposal represents an opening bid designed to shape future negotiations or a final, non-negotiable offer from Moscow. Either way, it places Ukraine in a difficult position: accepting it would mean relinquishing sovereignty over large swaths of territory, while rejecting it risks prolonging a devastating war with no clear end in sight.

For Kyiv, the proposal appears almost impossible to accept. Zelensky's government has repeatedly made clear that no territorial concessions are on the table, including Donetsk, which Ukrainian officials view as essential to preventing further Russian incursions deeper into the country. The Russian plan also excludes an immediate cease-fire, instead requiring Ukraine to agree to all of Moscow's conditions before hostilities are suspended.

This point is particularly contentious. Ukraine has consistently called for a cease-fire as a starting point for any negotiations, citing the relentless bombardment of its cities by Russian missiles and drones. Without such a halt to the fighting, Zelensky argues, the credibility of any agreement would be in doubt.

"Russia continues to reject repeated calls for a cease-fire and has not decided when to stop the killing," Zelensky said in a late-night post on X. "If Moscow cannot give a simple order to end the attacks, how can we expect it to commit to something much bigger -- peaceful coexistence for decades?".

Beyond Donbas, Putin's proposal includes demands for official recognition of Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that remains unrecognized by most of the international community. Sources told Reuters it was unclear whether the Kremlin expects this recognition to come from Washington alone or from Ukraine and its Western allies as well. For Kyiv and European capitals, any recognition of the annexation remains a nonstarter.

Moscow is also insisting that Ukraine abandon its pursuit of NATO membership. While Putin has suggested that alternative security guarantees for Ukraine could be discussed, Kyiv continues to view NATO accession as a strategic objective central to its long-term defense. European leaders briefed on the talks said Trump floated the idea of offering Ukraine a form of collective security outside of NATO, similar in principle to the alliance's Article 5 defense commitment, which treats an attack on one member as an attack on all. Whether such an arrangement would satisfy Ukraine remains highly doubtful.

The Kremlin's demands extend beyond territorial and security matters. According to the same sources, Moscow wants official status for the Russian language throughout Ukraine, or at least in parts of its territory, and guarantees that the Moscow-linked Orthodox Church can operate freely.

Kyiv, however, has accused the church of spreading pro-Russian propaganda and aiding Moscow's war effort, charges the institution denies. Ukraine recently passed legislation restricting religious organizations with ties to Russia, further complicating this demand.

While the Alaska summit did not produce the cease-fire Trump reportedly hoped for, the U.S. president struck an optimistic tone in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. He said he and Putin had discussed territorial arrangements and security guarantees for Ukraine and claimed the two sides were "largely in agreement." "I believe we are very close to a deal," Trump said, adding that "Ukraine has to agree" to the plan. He conceded, however, that "maybe they will say no."

For Zelensky, Moscow's refusal to halt its attacks remains the central obstacle. With daily strikes devastating Ukrainian cities and infrastructure, the Ukrainian president has warned that any peace framework that does not start with a cease-fire risks being meaningless. As he prepares to meet Trump in Washington, Zelensky faces a delicate balancing act: securing Western support while firmly resisting pressure to cede territory that his government considers non-negotiable.

Whether Putin's proposal marks the beginning of serious negotiations or simply another attempt to test Western unity remains to be seen. For now, Ukraine and its allies remain deeply skeptical, viewing the terms as heavily tilted in Moscow's favor and unlikely to bring the durable peace the region so desperately needs.

18. Ammonnews : Melania Trump calls for end to war in Ukraine in 'peace letter' hand-delivered to Putin

Ammon News - First Lady Melania Trump penned a "peace letter" to Russian President Vladimir Putin, pushing for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine and lamenting the violent conflict's harm on the youngest generation.

The "peace letter" focused on the war's detrimental impact on children caught in the crosshairs and was handed to Putin by President Trump before their summit in Alaska to discuss the war, Fox News reported.

Putin immediately read the letter while American and Russian delegations watched on.

"Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation's rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger," the first lady wrote in a letter obtained by the outlet.

"As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation's hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few."

"Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter. In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone -- you serve humanity itself," Melania pleaded.

The "peace letter" was written before the meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska -- the first major meeting between the US and Russia since June 2021, a mere eight months before the war started.

Still, the US and Russia have been in frequent communication primarily over the phone, and especially in recent months as Trump has tried to broker an end to the deadly war. NYP


19. Turkey: Over 250 evacuated overnight as rescuers battle wildfire in Gallipoli

More than 250 people were evacuated overnight as a wildfire raged on the Gallipoli peninsula flanking the Dardanelles Strait, where Turkish firefighters were battling Sunday to quench the blaze, officials said.

The fire began on Saturday in the northwestern province of Canakkale, and spread quickly due to high winds in the hills near the town of Gelibolu, on the shores of the busy shipping strait.

"As a precaution, 251 residents from five villages were relocated to safe areas," Canakkale governor Omer Toraman wrote on X.

Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels.

Footage showed the hillsides illuminated by bright flames while huge clouds of smoke poured into the night air.

Toraman said the province, a popular destination for tourists visiting the ancient ruins of Troy, as well as the Gallipoli battleground where thousands of soldiers died in World War I, had suffered "extremely severe drought" over the past year.

While the weather has been fairly normal for the time of year, much of northwestern Turkey has suffered strong winds in recent days, although they eased off on Sunday.

Firefighters worked through the night, with 12 planes and 18 helicopters rejoining the efforts at first light in an operation involving 900 people, the forestry directorate said on X.

The authority in charge of the war memorials said on X that access to historical sites near the town of Eceabat had been closed "due to the ongoing forest fire".

On Monday, another fire on the other side of the strait forced 2,000 people to flee, with around 80 treated for smoke inhalation.

Several days earlier, another fire forced the evacuation of 120 people and the suspension of shipping through the Dardanelles Strait, which links the Mediterranean with the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea.

According to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) website, there have been 192 wildfires in Turkey this year, which have ravaged more than 110,373 hectares (273,000 acres) of land.

Experts say human-driven climate change is causing more frequent and more intense wildfires and other natural disasters, and have warned Turkey to take measures to tackle the problem.

1. Loyalty programmes in Ghana: The next frontier in customer retention - MyJoyOnline

Rosemary Tham - Lead of Card Product Management, Access Bank Ghana

In today's increasingly digital economy, customer loyalty is no longer earned by good service alone, it is maintained by smart, relevant engagement. Loyalty programs have become critical tools in this endeavor, and their evolution in Ghana presents an exciting shift in how brands, especially within the financial sector, connect with their customers.

The concept of loyalty programs has existed for over four decades, originating in the United States where airline miles became a pioneering form of customer retention. Over time, the strategy evolved into points systems, cashback schemes, exclusive rewards, and experiential benefits across industries from hospitality to retail to banking.

While much of this evolution happened in Western markets, Ghana is quickly catching up. With the surge in digital transactions particularly driven by mobile money, e-commerce, and card payments, there is now a clear opportunity to deepen customer relationships through loyalty strategies designed for our local context.

What has changed? Quite simply, Ghanaians are transacting differently. Consumers are more open to digital channels than ever before, and financial institutions are increasingly recognizing that loyalty needs to move beyond seasonal promotions and towards long-term value exchange.

Loyalty in Ghana: Still nascent, but poised for growth

In Ghana, loyalty programs are still relatively underdeveloped, especially in the banking sector. Many consumers remain unaware of the variety of payment card products available to them; debit, prepaid, credit, and the benefits that come with each. More importantly, the idea that everyday transactions can accumulate into tangible rewards is still novel to many.

However, the tide is shifting. Across retail, telecoms, and now banking, we are witnessing more interest in loyalty infrastructure not just as a marketing gimmick but as a way to build affinity and encourage repeat behaviour. The best loyalty programs are now data-driven, personalized, and embedded seamlessly into customer journeys.

The shift from cash to card and why loyalty matters

As digital adoption increases, particularly among younger demographics and urban consumers, the use of payment cards is gaining traction. Today's users are more likely to pay for subscriptions, shop online, or travel with their cards than they were even a few years ago. With that behaviour comes a need to acknowledge and reward usage in ways that feel meaningful.

Modern loyalty programs in the financial space now go beyond just cashback. They offer curated benefits like travel insurance, airport lounge access, merchant discounts, and points that can be redeemed across multiple platforms; from shopping to flights to hotel stays. It is not just about what customers spend but how and where they spend it.

The introduction of digital platforms that allow customers to track and redeem loyalty points in real time is enhancing transparency and reinforcing the sense of reward. These platforms allow customers to choose how they use their points, whether it's booking a weekend getaway or topping up for groceries.

A case in progress: Banking and the loyalty evolution

In recent years, a few banks in Ghana have started rolling out full-scale loyalty programs tied directly to card usage. These initiatives reward customers for POS transactions, online payments, and other non-cash activities, encouraging a shift away from ATM withdrawals and into more formalized, traceable financial habits.

One such initiative that has garnered attention is a tier-based loyalty program launched by Access Bank (Ghana) PLC, offering points for every spend above a minimum threshold. The innovation lies in its inclusivity, targeting not just premium clients but also gradually onboarding mass market users during key campaign seasons. The goal is to make loyalty accessible, not elitist.

Early data shows promising engagement, with customers already redeeming points for merchandise, lifestyle experiences, and even airline tickets. Perhaps most significantly, these programs promote a sense of connection, reminding customers that their bank sees and values their everyday decisions.

Looking Ahead: Loyalty as a strategic lever

As Ghana's financial landscape becomes more competitive, loyalty will become a key differentiator. But it must be more than window dressing. The future belongs to programs that are intuitive, rewarding, and emotionally resonant, ones that treat customers not just as account holders, but as valued partners in a long-term relationship.

This evolution requires education, especially around product differentiation and digital literacy. It also demands consistency. Customers must see that rewards are not occasional surprises but reliable returns for sustained engagement.

The loyalty journey in Ghana is still in its early days, but the momentum is undeniable. For those of us shaping the future of card products and customer experience, the opportunity to build genuine, data-informed loyalty is both exciting and long overdue.

2. "Globalize the Intifada": Manhattan Rally Sparks Alarm Among Jews

On Saturday, thousands gathered in Manhattan for an anti-Israel rally that turned into one of the most brazen displays of pro-intifada rhetoric seen in the United States in years. Chants of "Globalize the Intifada" echoed across Midtown as demonstrators demanded an end to U.S. aid to Israel. For many Jews, the words felt like a chilling throwback to some of the darkest moments in modern Israeli history.

The slogan, used repeatedly throughout the rally, has become a focal point in the broader debate over whether pro-Palestinian activism is crossing the line into outright incitement. Jewish groups warn that the phrase is not merely symbolic, but a call for spreading the type of violence that defined the First and Second Intifadas.

The word intifada -- Arabic for "uprising" -- is not neutral. It carries the weight of bloody campaigns that specifically targeted Jewish civilians.

The First Intifada (1987-1990) included widespread riots, assaults, and Molotov cocktail attacks on Israelis, along with killings of Jews in mixed cities. The Second Intifada (2000-2005) escalated into a terror war. Suicide bombers blew up buses, caf√©s, nightclubs, and schools. Thousands were wounded and over a thousand Israelis were killed -- many of them women, children, and teenagers. Among the most haunting attacks were the Dolphinarium disco bombing in Tel Aviv that killed 21 Jewish teens, and the Hebrew University bombing in 2002 that killed nine people, including five American students.

Speaking to the crowd, Brian Becker, director of the radical ANSWER Coalition, told the crowd that "the US government is standing with the fascist regime in Tel Aviv, but we, the American people, stand with you, the Palestinian people."

Becker added that "they're in Wall Street, they're in the White House, they're in the center of imperialism."

For Jews, invoking the "intifada" is not abstract -- it is an open call to repeat this terror on a global scale.

The American Jewish Committee (AJC) has emphasized that calls to "globalize the intifada" are inherently threatening because they glorify violence against Jews. According to the AJC, this rhetoric "normalizes the idea that attacking Jews and Israelis is not only acceptable, but necessary." Even if demonstrators claim they do not intend violence, the phrase's impact is unavoidably menacing to Jews, who recall how these uprisings translated into bloody massacres of civilians.

The AJC also warned that antisemitic rhetoric fuels real-world violence. The United States has seen a surge of antisemitic incidents, with the ADL reporting a 344% rise over the last five years. Chanting for a "global intifada" in New York City -- home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel -- intensifies fears that words will lead to attacks.

The slogan recently spilled into the city's political scene when Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist and candidate for New York City mayor, was pressed on the phrase. Initially, Mamdani argued that it symbolized Palestinian resistance and was not inherently violent. But Jewish leaders, Democratic officials, and even the business community reacted with outrage, accusing him of trivializing Jewish suffering.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand called on Mamdani to denounce the phrase outright, insisting that New York must be represented by someone who respects all communities. Facing mounting pressure, Mamdani later pledged he would not use the slogan himself and would discourage others from invoking it. But the damage was done: many Jewish New Yorkers now view him with deep suspicion, seeing his refusal to immediately disavow the term as a troubling sign.

In Washington, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) introduced a resolution condemning the use of "Globalize the Intifada," warning that it encourages violence against Jews everywhere. The resolution gained bipartisan support, with Republicans and Democrats alike insisting that rhetoric associated with terrorism cannot be normalized in American politics.

The Manhattan rally also featured other chants that are increasingly common at anti-Israel demonstrations, such as "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free." This phrase erases Israel's existence entirely, calling for Palestinian sovereignty from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea -- that is, in place of the world's only Jewish state.

For Jewish communities, this is not a call for coexistence but a call for ethnic cleansing. Its use is widely recognized as antisemitic, a message that the Jewish people do not deserve sovereignty anywhere.

Tragically, rhetoric has already spilled over into deadly acts. In May, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, a couple and Israeli embassy aides, were fatally shot as they were leaving the Lillian & Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., shortly after demonstrators in the city were heard chanting "From the river to the sea." For many Jews, it is impossible to separate such words from the violence they inspire.

Jewish organizations stress that the repetition of phrases like "Globalize the Intifada" and "From the river to the sea" serves not only as political expression but also as a signal of menace. To Jewish ears, they echo a long history of antisemitic violence.

At a moment when antisemitism is surging globally -- from synagogue vandalism to physical assaults on Jews in Western cities -- normalizing intifada rhetoric is reckless. The slogans are not just "pro-Palestinian," they are anti-Jewish and call into question the safety of Jews everywhere.

The events in Manhattan should serve as a wake-up call. When antisemitic slogans rooted in terrorism are shouted openly in the heart of New York, it is not just a matter of free speech -- it is a matter of public safety.

History shows that words matter. The First and Second Intifadas began with rhetoric and quickly spiraled into campaigns of terror. In our own time, slogans like "Globalize the Intifada" and "From the river to the sea" have already been followed by acts of violence against Jews in the United States.

Policymakers, law enforcement, and community leaders face a stark choice: either take this rhetoric seriously and confront it, or risk allowing it to lay the groundwork for the next wave of antisemitic violence on American soil.


3. Stop using 'unearned' academic title or face us in court - GTEC writes to Chief of Staff on Deputy Minister of Health Grace Ayensu-Danquah's title - MyJoyOnline

The Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC), currently on a national campaign to prevent the use of unearned academic titles in Ghana and enforce the law on the abuse, has concluded that the Deputy Minister of Health, Dr Grace Ayensu-Danquah does not hold the academic title "Professor in any capacity".

GTEC has consequently written to the Chief of Staff at the Office of the President, as her employer, to ensure that she ceases presenting herself as such.

GTEC has also threatened that, should Dr Ayensu-Danquah continue to use the title "Professor", the Commission may be compelled to pursue legal action on grounds of public deception.

This was contained in a letter dated August 12, 2025, from GTEC, addressed to the Chief of Staff at the Office of the President, a copy of which has been sighted by Graphic Online.

The first correspondence was in a letter dated August 4, 2025, from GTEC to Dr. Ayensu-Danquah, with the Chief of Staff and Clerk of Parliament copied.

In that letter, reference was made to a personal interaction between the Board Chairman of GTEC and Dr Grace Ayensu-Danquah regarding her use of the academic title "Professor."

In the said letter, the Commission requested Dr Ayensu-Danquah to provide verifiable evidence of her appointment to the rank of Professor with a deadline of August 11, 2025.

Subsequently, on August 8, 2025, solicitors for Dr. Ayensu-Danquah, represented by David K. Ametefe, responded to the Commission.

In their correspondence, they stated that Dr. Ayensu-Danquah had been appointed as an Assistant Professor of Surgery by the University of Utah, USA.

They also questioned the authority of GTEC to request such evidence, given that the appointment was made outside the jurisdiction of Ghana.

According to GTEC, "instead of documentary evidence of a Professorial appointment, the solicitors submitted a letter from the University of Utah, signed by Prof. W. Bradford Rockwell, Vice Chair for Academic Affairs of the Department of Surgery, dated August 7, 2025.

And that letter, a copy of which has also been sighted by Graphic Online, indicated that Dr. Ayensu-Danquah was appointed as an Adjunct Assistant Professor.

"Sir, the Commission wishes to clarify the following key points:

1. Contrary to the assertion in the letter from her solicitors, Dr. Ayensu-Danquah was not appointed as an Assistant Professor but as an Adjunct Assistant Professor, as clearly stated in the letter from the University of Utah. The omission of the word "Adjunct" by her legal representatives is both misleading and troubling.

2. According to the letter from Dr. Rockwell, the position of Adjunct Assistant Professor is not a tenure-track role. He further explains that academic position titles used by the University of Utah may not directly correspond to those within Ghana's academic framework.

3. For clarity, within the context of Ghanaian higher education, an Adjunct Assistant Professor is roughly equivalent to a Part-time Lecturer, and not even comparable to the rank of Senior Lecturer, let alone Professor," the letter stated.

4. GTEC indicated that it was based on the above that the Commission has concluded that Dr. Grace Ayensu-Danquah does not hold the title of Professor in any capacity.

"We therefore respectfully call on you, her employer, to ensure that she ceases presenting herself as such. Should Dr. Ayensu-Danquah continue to use the title "Professor", the Commission may be compelled to pursue legal action on grounds of public deception," the GTEC letter signed Professor Ahmed Jinapor Abdulai as Director-General added.

Dear Madam,

REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF ACADEMIC TITLE (PROFESSOR)

We refer to your recent engagement with the Chairman of the Board of the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC), during which preliminary discussions were held concerning the basis on which you currently bear the title of "Professor."

Following this engagement, the Commission is formally requesting that you submit official documentary evidence of your appointment or promotion to the rank of Associate Professor or Professor through a recognized academic process.

For the avoidance of doubt, GTEC is deeply concerned about the inappropriate use of academic titles that have not been duly earned or conferred by accredited academic institutions. The use of such titles - especially where they lack formal academic validation-is misleading and contrary to the established academic protocols and standards governing the conferment and usage of academic ranks in Ghana.

Hon. for your information and guidance, the standard academic progression in Ghana follows this

sequence: Lecturer ‚Üí Senior Lecturer ‚Üí Associate Professor ‚Üí Professor

It is acknowledged that in some countries, such as the United States, academic titles may be used more informally, and many teaching staff may be referred to as "Professor" regardless of their official rank.

However, such informal conventions do not align with the formal academic ranking system recognized and upheld in Ghana.

In light of the above, the Commission respectfully requests that you provide the following documentation by 11th August, 2025:

Should you be unable to provide the required documentation, you are required to immediately cease the use of the title "Professor."

Furthermore, you must provide verifiable evidence confirming the withdrawal of the title from all relevant platforms, including but not limited to:

In accordance with GTEC's mandate to uphold academic integrity within Ghana's higher education system, please be advised that until the requested documentation is received and verified, you are not to use the title "Professor" in any institutional, professional, or public capacity.

Please note that this correspondence is being copied to your employer, through the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Republic of Ghana.

Additionally, the Clerk of Parliament of the Republic of Ghana, in view of your role as the Member of Parliament for the Essikado-Ketan Constituency, has also been copied for appropriate action.

The Commission expects your full cooperation. Please be advised that failure to comply with this directive

may result in the application of appropriate sanctions.

Also attached below is a copy of the letter from the University of Utah, signed by Prof. W. Bradford Rockwell, Vice Chair for Academic Affairs of the Department of Surgery, dated August 7, 2025.

Dear Sir/Madam.

Grace Ayensu-Danquah, MD is an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Surgery at the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine at the University of Utah.

Ghanaian cultural tours

Her important academic contributions are organized through the Center for Global Surgery, a component of the Surgery Department.

Being the Vice Chair for Academic Affairs for the Surgery Department, I oversee academic appointments and promotions. Being an honorary member of the Ghana College of Physicians and Surgeons and the West African College of Surgeons, I have some basic knowledge of academic appointments in Ghana.

Our academic position nomenclature does not exactly translate to comparable academic positions in Ghana. The different tracks give some information on a faculty member's academic work. Tenure track applies to faculty members with clinical and significant research/administrative duties. Clinical track signifies significant clinical duties with some research/administrative/teaching duties.

Research track is for research faculty, most of whom are PhD. Adjunct track identifies faculty who work in other departments, other schools, or other countries, but contribute to the University of Utah Department of Surgery through clinical, research teaching or administrative duties. Adjunct faculty are important contributors to the academic mission.

Sincerely yours,

Attached below is a copy of the letter from the solicitors for Dr Ayensu-Danquah dated August 8, 2025, responding to the GTEC letter dated August 4, 2025

Dear Sir,

RE : REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF ACADEMIC TITLE (PROFESSOR)

Your letter titled above, dated 4th August, 2025, and referenced as AC81/0/01, has been referred to us by our client Honourable Dr. Grace Ayensu Danquah, Member of Parliament for Essikado-Ketan and Deputy Minister of Health.

Our instructions are to respond to your said letter which we hereby do as follows:

In general, we find your letter to be an unjustified attempt to intimidate our client and to publicly distract others from her

accomplishments. Rather than be subjected to your criticisms and petty wordsmithing, she should be praised for voluntarily

deploying her remarkable education and professional experience in the service of her fellow citizens of Ghana.

It is our hope that you would exhibit some moderation in your future conduct towards her and in your exercise of your statutory

authority.


4. Explained: How Trump's Tariffs May Boomerang, Binding BRICS Nations Closer - The Weekend Edit

United States President Donald Trump walked into a summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, pressing for a ceasefire and threatening "severe consequences" and tough sanctions if the Kremlin leader didn't agree to halt the fighting in Ukraine. On the contrary, Trump was the one who dropped his demand for a ceasefire in favour of pursuing a full and final peace accord, a position that aligns with Putin's. In the same manner, it appears that Trump's tariff policy may also boomerang - intended to target nations like India and Brazil, is seems instead to be knitting the BRICS bloc tighter.


5. Mexico wins women's flag football gold as China places sixth at World Games

CHENGDU, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Mexico scored a last-second touchdown to edge the United States 26-21 in the women's flag football final at Chengdu World Games here on Sunday as host China finished sixth.

At The World Games 2022, Mexico crushed the U.S. 39-6 in the final. Three years later, the two flag football powerhouses demonstrated remarkable defensive resilience, with both sides shutting down the opponents' first three drives.

The breakthrough came in the last minute of the first half, when Ashlea Klam put the U.S. on the scoresheet with a touchdown, while Mexico responded swiftly as Monica Rangel and Tania Rincon scored twice within 20 seconds to seize a 14-7 halftime lead.

In the second half, the U.S. rallied from behind to lead 21-20 with only 28 seconds remaining. However, Mexico's Victoria Chavez sealed the victory with the decisive touchdown before the final whistle.

Earlier on Sunday, Canada beat Austria 38-20 in the bronze medal game.

China lost to Britain 34-13 in the fifth-placed match, ending its debut international campaign with one victory and five losses.

"We made some unnecessary errors on the pitch. It's part of the process as these girls have only trained for three months," said the Chinese team head coach Guo Ruibin.

"Our players need to practice more to really understand the sport. Hopefully we can learn from this competition and grow step by step," he added.


6. Grace Ayensu-Danquah not a professor - GTEC - Ghanamma.com

The Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) has disputed claims by Dr. Grace Ayensu-Danquah that she holds the academic rank of professor, urging her to desist from presenting herself with the title.

In a letter addressed to the Chief of Staff at the Presidency, GTEC explained that the Commission had earlier requested Dr. Ayensu-Danquah to provide documentary evidence of her professorial appointment by 11th August 2025.

Her legal team, led by David K. Ametefe, responded on August 8, insisting that she was appointed an Assistant Professor of Surgery by the University of Utah in the United States.

They further argued that GTEC had no authority to demand such evidence since the appointment was made outside Ghana.

However, GTEC noted discrepancies in the documents submitted. A letter from the University of Utah, signed by Prof. W. Bradford Rockwell, Vice Chair for Academic Affairs in the Department of Surgery, confirmed that Dr. Ayensu-Danquah was appointed as an Adjunct Assistant Professor, not Assistant Professor as claimed by her solicitors.

The Commission stressed that the omission of the term "Adjunct" was misleading. It further explained that the position of Adjunct Assistant Professor is a non-tenure track role, and within Ghana's academic framework, it equates roughly to a part-time lecturer -- not a senior lecturer, and certainly not a professor.

"Based on the above, the Commission concludes that Dr. Grace Ayensu-Danquah does not hold the title of Professor in any capacity," the letter stated.

GTEC has therefore called on her employers to ensure she ceases presenting herself as a professor. It also warned that should she persist, the Commission may take legal action on grounds of public deception.

Attached to the letter were GTEC's earlier correspondence dated 4th August 2025, the University of Utah's clarification, and the response from Dr. Ayensu-Danquah's solicitors.


7. UK PM Keir Starmer joins 'Coalition of the Willing' talks over Russia-Ukraine conflict

LONDON: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined a video call with European allies on Sunday ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House next week for talks with US President Donald Trump over the country's ongoing conflict with Russia.

Starmer was joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz as hosts of the "Coalition of the Willing", after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit in Alaska in pursuit of peace on Friday.

Starmer praised the American President's efforts, which he said had "brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia's illegal war in Ukraine" and reiterated Europe's "unwavering support" for Ukraine.

"His leadership in pursuit of an end to the killing should be commended. While progress has been made, the next step must be further talks involving President Zelenskyy. The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without him," Starmer said in a statement issued by Downing Street.

"I welcome the openness of the United States, alongside Europe, to provide robust security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any deal."

Calling it "important progress", he said it will be crucial in "deterring Putin from coming back for more".

"In the meantime, until he (Putin) stops his barbaric assault, we will keep tightening the screws on his war machine with even more sanctions, which have already had a punishing impact on the Russian economy and its people," Starmer said.

On Saturday, in a joint statement with Macron, Merz and other European Union (EU) leaders, Starmer welcomed Trump's debrief following his meeting with Putin which ended without any ceasefire agreement.

"As President Trump said 'there's no deal until there's a deal'. As envisioned by President Trump, the next step must now be further talks including President Zelenskyy, whom he will meet soon," the leaders said.

"The Coalition of the Willing is ready to play an active role. No limitations should be placed on Ukraine's armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine's pathway to EU and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation). It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force," they noted.

It came as some media reports indicate that Putin expects Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas region, parts of which Russia has attempted to occupy during the conflict.

'The Financial Times' reported that the Russian President told Trump that he would freeze the conflict along much of the frontline if his demands were met.


8. Scientists claim chances of curing baldness are growing | The National

Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States, famously joked that just two things in life were certain: death and taxes.

For many men, however, a third inevitability looms - baldness.

In June, Pelage Pharmaceuticals announced "positive results" from Phase 2a clinical trials of PP405, a drug which aims to combat male-pattern baldness and the thinning of hair in women.

The drug is designed to "reactivate dormant hair follicle stem cells" and could become a "first-in-class" treatment for men and women, Pelage Pharmaceuticals said in a statement.

The treatment could "go beyond slowing the hair loss process and directly drive hair follicle regeneration," said Dr Christina Weng, the company's chief medical officer.

"This as a milestone that expands the possibilities of regenerative medicine," she added. "As we advance into the next stage of clinical development, our focus remains on delivering a science-driven solution that works for everyone."

The phase 2a trials involved 78 participants, both men and women - with each person applying the drug or a placebo to their scalp once a day for four weeks.

According to the results published by the company, four weeks after the treatment finished, an increase in hair density of 20 per cent or more was seen in almost one third of men who had a greater degree of hair loss. No improvement was observed in the placebo group.

Pelage Pharmaceuticals says what is particularly significant is the drug's apparent ability to kick-start hair growth in follicles where no hair was previously present.

PP405 has been developed by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and targets a series of chemical reactions in cells. Male-pattern baldness is largely caused by genes, although environmental factors also play a role. In some men it begins in their late teens, with rates increasing with age.

A US study found that 16 per cent of men aged 18 to 29 had "moderate to extensive" hair loss, while among 40-somethings the figure was 53 per cent. Over their lifetime, 80 per cent of men will experience hair loss.

Also, about 40 per cent of women will be affected by a thinning of their hair cover.

Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School, said that with respect to medication, "some progress" had been made with male-pattern baldness.

"It's inducing the hair follicles to be stimulated to wake up and start doing things they used to do once upon a time," he said.

A true cure, however, remains elusive. Indeed a 2023 paper in Trends in Biotechnology said that the most effective treatment remained a hair transplant.

This paper noted that "the needs and expectations of patients" were typically not met by current drug treatments, which were often expensive and had limited effectiveness.

According to the study, only two drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration have been marketed as treatments following four decades of research - and these were branded as being only "marginally effective".

According to figures quoted in the Trends in Biotechnology paper, the global alopecia market was worth $7.6 billion in 2020, and by 2028 is likely to reach $13 billion. Some estimates have put the sector's value as being even higher.

"Because it's a huge market there's a lot of research to find a solution," Dr Pankhania said. "I remain optimistic, just as I remain optimistic with the management of [other conditions including] sickle cell anaemia. There's a demand."

While PP405 has sparked many headlines, there are many other strands of research aimed at gaining a better understanding of male-pattern baldness in the hope of finding a cure. Much of this centres on the genetic basis for the condition.

Research by the University of Bonn and other institutions in Germany, published in 2023, found a link between rare variants of five genes and male-pattern baldness. The results, the university said when its findings were released, could lead to improved treatments.

So for those whose hair is thinning or has almost completely gone, there are causes for optimism - assuming, of course, that they feel that their baldness needs to be cured.


9. European leaders to join Zelensky for Ukraine talks with Trump | Fox 11 Tri Cities Fox 41 Yakima

European leaders will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his visit to Washington on Monday seeking an end to Moscow's invasion, after President Donald Trump dropped his push for a ceasefire following his Alaska summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Securing a ceasefire in Ukraine, more than three years after the Kremlin ordered the invasion, had been one of Trump's core demands before the summit, to which Ukraine and its European allies were not invited.

But after a meeting that yielded no clear breakthrough, Trump ruled out an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine -- a move that would appear to favour Putin, who has long argued for negotiations on a final peace deal.

Ukraine and its European allies have criticised it as a way to buy time and press Russia's battlefield advances, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen among the leaders set to try and bend Trump's ear on the matter.

Ahead of the Washington visit on Monday, von der Leyen said on X she would welcome Zelensky for a meeting in Brussels on Sunday which other European leaders would join by video call, before accompanying the Ukrainian leader on his US trip at his "request" with "other European leaders".

The German government confirmed Merz was among those other European leaders, and would try to emphasise "interest in a swift peace agreement in Ukraine".

Finland said its president, Alexander Stubb, would also travel to Washington.

Trump briefed Zelensky and European leaders on his flight back from Alaska to Washington, saying afterwards that "it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a peace agreement which would end the war."

Ceasefire agreements "often times do not hold up," Trump added on his Truth Social platform.

But Zelensky has appeared unconvinced by the change of tack, saying on Saturday that it "complicates the situation".

If Moscow lacks "the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater -- peaceful coexistence with its neighbours for decades," he said on social media.

- 'Harsh reality' -

Trump expressed support during his call with Zelensky and European leaders for a proposal by Putin to take full control of two largely Russian-held Ukrainian regions in exchange for freezing the frontline in two others, an official briefed on the talks told AFP.

Putin "de facto demands that Ukraine leave Donbas," an area consisting of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine, the source said.

In exchange, Russian forces would halt their offensive in the Black Sea port region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, where the main cities are still under Ukrainian control.

Several months into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia in September 2022 claimed to have annexed all four Ukrainian regions even though its troops still do not fully control any of them.

"The Ukrainian president refused to leave Donbas," the source said.

Trump notably also said the United States was prepared to provide Ukraine security guarantees, an assurance Merz hailed as "significant progress."

But there was a scathing assessment of the summit outcome from the European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas, who accused Putin of seeking to "drag out negotiations" with no commitment to end the bloodshed.

"The harsh reality is that Russia has no intention of ending this war any time soon," Kallas said.

- Zelensky back in White House -

The main diplomatic focus now switches to Zelensky's talks at the White House on Monday.

The Ukrainian president's last Oval Office visit in February ended in an extraordinary shouting match, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly berating Zelensky for not showing enough gratitude for US aid.

In an interview with broadcaster Fox News after his sit-down with Putin, Trump had suggested that the onus was now on Zelensky to secure a peace deal as they work towards an eventual trilateral summit with Putin.

"It's really up to President Zelensky to get it done," Trump said.

- European pressure -

In an earlier statement, European leaders welcomed the plan for a Trump-Putin-Zelensky summit but added that they would maintain pressure on Russia in the absence of a ceasefire.

Meanwhile, the conflict in Ukraine raged on, with both Kyiv and Moscow launching attack drones at each other Sunday.

Back in Moscow, Putin said his summit talks with Trump had been "timely" and "very useful."

In his post-summit statement in Alaska, Putin had warned Ukraine and European countries not to engage in any "behind-the-scenes intrigues" that could disrupt what he called "this emerging progress."

10. Von der Leyen to travel to Washington to join Zelenskyy-Trump talks

Many European leaders are set to join Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his visit to the White House on Monday to meet with his US counterpart Donald Trump.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to arrive in Brussels where he will meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The pair will then together participate in the virtual meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

In a post on X, von der Leyen says she will then join Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday to participate in his meeting with US President Donald Trump, at Zelenskyy's request.

The Commission president noted that other European leaders will also join the meeting, but it's not clear as of yet whether they will be travelling to Washington or joining virtually.

Berlin says Merz will also be travelling to the US capital on Monday to join the talks.

"The trip will serve as an exchange of information with US President Donald Trump following his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska," said the chancellor's spokesperson.

The Elysee have also confirmed Macron's attendance in Monday's talks.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is also believed to be attending. Italian media say Meloni has cut short her holiday and returned to Rome on Sunday to prepare to travel to the United States.

Foreign portfolio investors offloaded Indian equity holdings by approximately Rs 21,000 crore in early August 2025, driven by US-India trade disputes, muted Q1 corporate results, and rupee depreciation.The total FPI equity outflows reached Rs 1.16 lakh crore in 2025, as per depository records. Meanwhile, depository data also show that FPIs withdrew Rs 20,975 crore from equities through August 14. This follows July's Rs 17,741 crore withdrawal, which contrasts with the Rs 38,673 crore investment during March to June.The reduced US-Russia tensions and absence of new sanctions indicate that the proposed 25 per cent secondary tariff on India might not be implemented after August 27, benefiting markets, according to Vaqarjaved Khan, CFA - Senior Fundamental Analyst, Angel One, as quoted by PTI.S&P's upgrade of India's credit rating from BBB- to BBB could positively influence FPI outlook, he further noted."The sustained outflows are being driven primarily by a confluence of global uncertainties. Heightened geopolitical tensions and ambiguity surrounding the interest rate trajectory in developed economies, particularly the United States, have contributed to a risk-averse sentiment," stated Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director - Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India.The strengthening US dollar has reduced emerging market investments' appeal, including India's, he explained.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments, attributed the outflows to modest earnings growth and high valuations.Continuous selling affected IT sector performance, while banking and financial sectors remained stable due to reasonable valuations and institutional investment.Conversely, FPIs invested Rs 4,469 crore in debt general limits and Rs 232 crore through the voluntary retention route during this period.

5. [Finlight] ‚ÄòStunning survival story‚Äô: Police rescue California man trapped behind waterfall for two days

A California man who recently became trapped behind a waterfall for two days while climbing was dramatically rescued by police utilizing a helicopter.

Ryan Wardwell, 46, of Long Beach, went to waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups on 10 August with plans to rappel down, the sheriff‚Äôs office of Tulare country said in a social media post. But the ‚Äúextreme hydraulics‚Äù of the waterfalls pushed Wardwell off his rappelling lines and trapped him behind a cascade of the Kern river, according to the sheriff‚Äôs office.

His failure to return to his car that night prompted local law enforcement to spend 11 August searching for him with infrared technology and aircraft. Difficult terrain and fading daylight thwarted their efforts that day. But rescuers found Wardwell the next day after flying a drone behind the cascade in question.

Wardwell was alive and conscious when rescuers spotted him, and he told them how he had become stranded there, the Tulare county sheriff‚Äôs office said. A California highway patrol helicopter crew then managed to hoist him to safety to cap off what the sheriff‚Äôs office declared a ‚Äústunning survival story‚Äù.

Wardwell received treatment for dehydration and ‚Äúonly minor injuries‚Äù, and he was reunited with family who had gone to the scene, the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

The agency published video of Wardwell‚Äôs rescue on Facebook, where it captured attention from news media outlets that reported on the situation. The clip showed the helicopter whipping around foliage and water around the cascade before the crew lifted Wardwell onboard.

An attraction for hiking and outdoors adventure enthusiasts, the Seven Teacups are in a secluded area about two hours south of the Sequoia national park, which itself is east of Visalia, California.

Wardwell had rappelled the falls several times before, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. On his 10 August trip there, friends had accompanied him, though they opted to stop going further after seeing the rushing water‚Äôs power, California highway patrol flight officer paramedic Mike Crane said to the Chronicle.

According to the outlet, Wardwell‚Äôs friends left a note on his car telling passersby to report him missing if the vehicle was still there the next day, which it was.

Wardwell ended up nestling himself in a dark cave beneath the waterfall ‚Äì completely soaked ‚Äì after being thrusted off his rappel lines, the Chronicle added.

Tulare county sheriff‚Äôs office captain Kevin Kemmerling told the Chronicle that Wardwell fought to escape for two days, ‚Äúbut there was nothing he could do to break through‚Äù.

‚ÄúThere was no way for him to warm up or dry out in there, so it had to have been miserable,‚Äù Kemmerling said to the newspaper.

Crane, speaking to the Chronicle, added: ‚ÄúI got the impression that maybe he didn‚Äôt know if he was ever going to get out of there.‚Äù

The Tulare sheriff‚Äôs office said in its statement that it reminded members of the public ‚Äúto always be aware of their environment and capabilities, especially when navigating white water rivers‚Äù like the one at the Seven Teacups.

‚ÄúStay safe, stay smart and stay alive,‚Äù the statement from the sheriff‚Äôs office said.

7. [Finlight] Pakistan floods: More than 200 missing in one district, official says

More than 200 missing in flood-hit district in Pakistan, official says

Rescue teams have buried eight unidentified bodies as there were no family members found alive to claim them, said Jehangir Khan, spokesman for the deputy commissioner office of Buner.

A local official in the worst-affected Buner district told the BBC that at least 209 people were still missing there, but it is feared that number could rise.

Flash floods have killed more than 300 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in recent days, with most of the deaths recorded in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

More than 200 people remain missing in one district of north-west Pakistan as a result of devastating monsoon flooding and landslides, an official has said.

Some relatives are also unable to claim their relatives bodies' as roads are severely damaged, he added.

A provincial rescue spokesman told news agency AFP that "10 to 12 entire villages" were partially buried.

Asfandyar Khattak, head of the provincial disaster management authority, said "dozens" of people were missing in Shangla district.

Monsoon rains between June and September deliver about three-quarters of South Asia's annual rainfall.

While landslides and flash floods are common as a result, scientists say that climate change is making these weather events more intense and more frequent.

Torrential rain has also hit Indian-administered Kashmir, days after at least 60 people were killed there by flash floods.

Nine were killed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir this week, while another five died in the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, authorities said.

Government forecasters say heavy rainfall is expected until 21 August in the north-west, where several areas have been declared disaster zones.

Pakistan has been reckoning with the devastation of this year's monsoon season since June. At least 650 people have been killed so far this year.

In July, Punjab, home to nearly half of Pakistan's 255 million people, recorded 73% more rainfall than the prior year and more deaths than in the entire previous monsoon season.

Northern Pakistan is also one of the most glaciated areas in the region, but these are rapidly thinning and retreating because of climate change - meaning rocks, soil, and other debris can be dislodged.

Monsoon rains can further destabilise mountain faces, exacerbating landslides that sometimes block rivers.

While the exact cause of the recent floods and landslides are yet to be determined, glaciologists say that ice melt is a contributing factor.

TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) ‚Äî Air Canada said it plans to resume flights on Sunday after the Canadian government intervened and forced the airline and its striking flight attendants back to work and into arbitration.

The strike stranded more than 100,000 travelers around the world during the peak summer travel season.

The country's largest airline said in a release that the first flights will resume Sunday evening but that it will take several days before its operations return to normal. It said some flights will be canceled over the next seven to 10 days until the schedule is stabilized.

Less than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. Hajdu referred the work stoppage to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.

The airline said Sunday the Canada Industrial Relations Board has extended the term of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.

The shutdown of Canada‚Äôs largest airline early Saturday was impacting about 130,000 people a day. Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.

According to numbers from aviation analytics provider Cirium, Air Canada had canceled a total of 671 flights by Saturday afternoon ‚Äî following 199 on Friday. And another 96 flights scheduled for Sunday were already suspended.

The bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada‚Äôs prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.

Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. EDT on Saturday. Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.

Last year, the government forced the country‚Äôs two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union‚Äôs leverage in negotiations.

The Business Council of Canada had urged the government to impose binding arbitration in this case, too. And the Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed the intervention.

Hajdu maintained that her Liberal government is not anti-union, saying it is clear the two sides are at an impasse.

Passengers whose flights are impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline‚Äôs website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.

The airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full ‚Äúdue to the summer travel peak.‚Äù

Air Canada and the Canadian Union of Public Employees have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal.

Both sides have said they remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work flight attendants do when planes aren‚Äôt in the air.

The airline‚Äôs latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said ‚Äúwould have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.‚Äù

But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn‚Äôt go far enough because of inflation.

Dell and HPE extend AI infrastructure lines with new Nvidia-powered systems

Two of the largest enterprise infrastructure vendors announced product line expansions designed to give customers more options for deploying artificial intelligence workloads at scale. New offerings from Dell Technologies Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. include systems and software updates that incorporate Nvidia Corp.'s latest graphics processing unit technology and AI software, alongside tools from other partners, to help organizations move from AI experimentation to production.

Dell said it's updating its AI Data Platform with new components aimed at improving unstructured data ingestion, transformation, retrieval and compute performance. The platform is designed to handle the full AI workload lifecycle, from data ingestion to agentic inference to knowledge retrieval.

A new unstructured data engine developed in collaboration with Elasticsearch BV provides real-time, secure access to large-scale unstructured datasets, supporting advanced vector search, semantic retrieval and hybrid keyword search. The engine integrates GPU acceleration and Nvidia NeMo Retriever microservices for use in retrieval-augmented generation applications.

The Dell AI Data Platform also integrates a federated SQL engine from Starburst Data Inc. for querying multiple data sources without moving the data, and an Apache Spark-based data processing engine for batch and real-time analytics. They sit alongside Dell's PowerScale and ObjectScale storage systems, which support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

On the hardware side, Dell introduced PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers equipped with Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, which are data center-class graphics and compute processors built on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and designed for AI inference, visual computing, engineering simulation and virtual workstation workloads. Dell said the new GPUs can deliver up to six times the token throughput for large language model inference compared to its previous generation, along with higher engineering simulation performance and support for more concurrent users.

The R7725 will be the first 2U server to integrate the Nvidia AI Data Platform reference design, a validated blueprint for building GPU-accelerated infrastructure. Dell said the pairing yields a turnkey system for fast inferencing, semantic search and large AI workloads.

HPE said it's expanding its line of AI-optimized systems with new configurations that also use Nvidia's Blackwell architecture GPUs, as well as the latest Nvidia AI models. The company said these updates are intended to support both agentic AI -- or systems that complete tasks autonomously or with little supervision tasks - and physical AI, which involves AI control of robotics and other hardware systems.

HPE is also adding new options to its Cray XD670 and XD675 servers that allow them to be configured with Nvidia GB200 NVL72 systems for large-scale AI training, or with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs for inference and smaller-scale workloads. HPE said both are pre-integrated with Nvidia's AI Enterprise software suite, including the NeMo framework and pretrained models such as Nvidia Nemotron for agentic AI and Cosmos for physical AI applications.

The company is also updating its GreenLake for AI offering to support the new systems. GreenLake is a consumption-based model for deploying AI infrastructure, allowing organizations to scale GPU resources as needed while keeping workloads on-premises or in colocation facilities. HPE said its Private Cloud AI will support the latest versions of the Nemotron and Cosmos models, as well as the latest Nvidia Blueprint for Video Search and Summarization.

Both companies' announcements center on integrating Nvidia's Blackwell-generation GPUs and related AI software into systems aimed at enterprises. Dell's focus is on connecting AI models to high-quality enterprise data, especially unstructured data, while HPE is emphasizing large-scale training and deployment of both agentic and physical AI models.

The announcements are part of a broader trend by infrastructure vendors to provide turnkey AI infrastructure that combines hardware, storage, networking and AI frameworks in pre-tested configurations.

Dell said its updated AI Data Platform with the unstructured data engine will be available later this year, alongside the PowerEdge R7725 and R770 servers with RTX PRO 6000 GPUs. HPE said its updated Cray XD systems and GreenLake AI configurations will also be available in the coming months.


2. China's Tech Boom Attracts Foreign Investment Surge

The rhythmic hum of robotic arms in Suzhou factories and the digital pulse of Shanghai's AI labs tell an economic success story decades in the making. China has surpassed its ambitious five-year foreign direct investment (FDI) target of $700 billion ahead of schedule, with utilized FDI hitting $708.73 billion by mid-2024 -- a powerful rebuttal to narratives of foreign capital flight. This milestone, achieved amid global protectionist headwinds, underscores China's transformation into a high-tech investment magnet where innovation outpaces politics.

Despite geopolitical turbulence and supply chain realignments, China's patient cultivation of foreign enterprise is yielding historic dividends. Ministry of Commerce data reveals foreign firms now drive one-third of China's foreign trade, contribute 25% of industrial value-added output, and account for 1 in 7 tax dollars. Critically, they've generated over 30 million jobs since 2019 -- equivalent to the population of Malaysia. The 14th Five-Year Plan's $700 billion FDI target, once viewed as ambitious, was eclipsed six months early. In H1 2024 alone, 30,014 new foreign-invested firms registered across China -- an 11.7% YoY surge. While overall utilized FDI dipped 15.2% to $58.9 billion due to 2023's record-high baseline, the structural shift toward high-value sectors signals enduring confidence. As Franz Decker, BMW Brilliance Automotive CEO, asserted during the opening of their Nanjing R&D hub: "China demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation."

China's innovation pivot is rewriting FDI playbooks. Foreign capital flowing into high-tech industries leaped from 28.3% of total FDI in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023 -- a trajectory accelerating in 2024. E-commerce services saw explosive 130% YoY FDI growth in H1, while AI, biotech, and advanced manufacturing drew multinationals seeking China's "new quality productive forces." The Third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in June became a showcase for this transformation, featuring BMW's new Nanjing facility -- its largest Asian IT R&D center -- designed to leverage China's "rapidly evolving tech landscape." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, attending CISCE, observed: "China's supply chain is a miracle -- the world's largest and most complex, built on deep technology, AI and software. Technology adoption here is so fast, it sets global trends." This tech-led FDI boom reflects China's 9% average FDI return rate -- among the world's highest -- and validates Beijing's 2024 Action Plan stabilizing foreign investment through streamlined approvals and market access.

The H1 2024 FDI dip requires contextual understanding. OECD data shows global FDI fell 7% in 2023, with developing Asia experiencing steeper declines. China's contraction aligns with this trend while masking sectoral dynamism. Crucially, reinvested earnings by existing foreign enterprises -- a key FDI metric -- remain robust as firms like BASF and Tesla expand Chinese facilities. The State Council's 24-point guidelines for foreign investors, emphasizing intellectual property protection and equal procurement access, further anchor confidence. As the Ministry of Commerce emphasized in its June policy briefing: "Quality supersedes quantity -- we welcome capital aligned with high-end manufacturing and digital transformation."

China's $708 billion FDI milestone proves its economic resilience isn't cyclical but structural -- built on world-class infrastructure, deep talent pools, and unwavering commitment to innovation-led growth. For global investors, the calculus remains clear: overlooking China's high-tech transformation means missing the defining economic opportunity of our decade. Explore partnership opportunities through China's International Investment Promotion Agency to position your enterprise at the convergence of technology and growth.

China's 14th Five-Year Plan targeted $700 billion in cumulative foreign direct investment between 2021-2025. Ministry of Commerce data confirms this goal was surpassed six months early, reaching $708.73 billion by June 2024.

High-tech industries now dominate China FDI flows, rising from 28.3% of total investment in 2019 to 37.4% in 2023. E-commerce, AI, and advanced manufacturing led growth, with e-commerce FDI surging nearly 130% YoY in H1 2024.

BMW CEO Franz Decker cited China's "remarkable vitality in digital innovation ecosystems" when launching their Nanjing R&D center. Proximity to tech talent, rapid commercialization, and supportive industrial policies make China indispensable for global innovation.

Officials attribute H1 2024's 15.2% FDI dip to 2023's unusually high baseline and global trends. The 2024 "Stabilizing Foreign Investment" Action Plan counters concerns through market access easing and IP protections.

At approximately 9%, China's FDI return rate outperforms most major economies, according to World Bank investment viability analyses. This sustains appeal despite geopolitical uncertainties.

Data contradicts this narrative. Beyond record cumulative FDI, 30,014 new foreign firms registered in H1 2024 -- an 11.7% YoY increase -- with expansions by firms like Nvidia and BASF confirming long-term commitment.


3. High-tech boom helps attract foreign investment: China Daily editorial

Years of efforts aimed at promoting the country's opening-up and continuously expanding market access for foreign enterprises have gradually paid off. Foreign-funded enterprises now contribute one-third of China's foreign trade, one-fourth of its value-added industrial output, and one-seventh of its tax revenues, and have created more than 30 million jobs over the past five years. It is little wonder therefore that the government should highly value foreign direct investment and always try its best to improve the business environment for foreign capital, so as to make the country a safe and promising destination for foreign investors.

The country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) set the target of attracting a total of $700 billion in foreign investment, with remarkable progress to be made in both the quantity and quality of utilized foreign investment. Despite the challenges posed by the rise of protectionism and unilateralism in recent years, the utilized foreign investment in China reached $708.73 billion by the end of June, suggesting the country has already achieved its five-year foreign investment target, ahead of schedule.

Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce released on the weekend also indicate that in the first half of this year the number of newly established foreign-invested companies increased by 11.7 percent year-on-year to 30,014, as the country continues to attract foreign capital into high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and high-end manufacturing.

The country's high-tech sector has become a major magnet for foreign capital thanks to its immense potential, with the percentage of utilized foreign investment in China's high-tech sector rising from 28.3 percent of the total in 2019 to 37.4 percent in 2023. In the first half of this year, foreign investment in e-commerce services alone recorded a nearly 130 percent year-on-year surge.

The development of a highly advanced innovation ecosystem in China has prompted a lot of multinationals to expand their investment in the sector in light of the country's forward-looking strategy. Take BMW for example. The German auto giant plans to establish its first China-based information technology research and development center in Nanjing, which will represent a huge expansion of the company's digital capabilities. The center is set to be BMW's largest IT R&D hub in Asia, and it is designed to strengthen the automaker's global production, sales and after-sales systems through digital solutions rooted in China's rapidly evolving tech landscape. Explaining the decision, Franz Decker, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, said during the signing ceremony with the local government on Friday that China "demonstrates remarkable vitality in building a thriving ecosystem for digital innovation".

The third China International Supply Chain Expo, which concluded on Sunday in Beijing, has earned a reputation for being a showcase for technological innovation and China's new quality productive forces. The expo highlighted how the country has embraced an innovation-driven development strategy in pursuit of high-quality development, which is expected to bring immense business opportunities for foreign companies. "Here in China ... the technology adoption is so fast," said Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO, during an interview on the sidelines of the expo, citing how China's innovative applications are setting global trends. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world ... built on deep technology, AI and software."

There have been some pointing to the actual use of FDI in China dropping 15.2 percent in the January-June period from a year earlier. Yet it should be noted that was amid a global decline in foreign investment, and the total volume of utilized FDI in China is 423.23 billion yuan ($58.9 billion), which remains significant. The decline can be attributed to the high comparison base last year. Any attempt to hype that foreign investment is leaving the country is out of ill intent.

In the past five years, the rate of return on FDI in China, at nearly 9 percent, still ranks among the highest around the world. It is the consensus among foreign investors that China remains an attractive destination for investment, not only because of its huge growth prospects, but also due to consistent government support aimed at enabling foreign-funded enterprises to achieve even greater success, as exemplified in an action plan that China released early this year to stabilize foreign investment.

No matter how the external environment may evolve, China remains firmly committed to high-standard opening-up and always welcomes foreign companies to keep investing in China and explore the Chinese market to enjoy the country's development dividends and progress together.

5. Economic Watch: China's AI Tech Boosts Global Trade Efficiency, Facilitates Supply Chain

Beijing: To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q and A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing. "Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

According to Namibia Press Agency, during discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade. Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model. "The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes. At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms. The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images, and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for the overseas market. Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba. As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in the global trade landscape. At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent, and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.

In a dialogue event on Thursday, Huang said China is clever about open-source engineering. "Open source has many global implications. It's not just helping the Chinese ecosystem; it's helping ecosystems around the world." China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce. Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.

China's open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Kimi and Qwen are powering supply chains across China and the rest of the world. In February, the NetEase Foreign Trade Express fully integrated with DeepSeek.

China's digitally deliverable service import and export value in 2024 grew by nearly 40 percent compared to 2020, as shown by figures released by the country's Ministry of Commerce.

Last year, China's digital economy core industries contributed about 10 percent of its GDP, while cross-border e-commerce exports grew by 16.9 percent year on year, according to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, who organized the CISCE.

An initiative launched at the expo calls for the digitalization and intelligent upgrading of supply chains, promoting interconnected data across the entire chain to create better conditions for international trade and investment cooperation.


9. China's AI tech boosts global trade efficiency, facilitates supply chain

BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- To provide a quick overview of what its digital technology can do for China's many small and medium-sized exporters, a Nanjing-based software firm put up nine striking Q&A posters at an ongoing trade fair in Beijing.

"Where is my product most in-demand overseas?" "How can I ensure my product passes customs compliance?" "Customers want low carbon and what should I do?" "How can I make global supply chain more cost-effective?" -- SKYTECH's AI tools can quickly provide tailored solutions to these questions.

During discussions about fragile global supply chains at the third China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), participants noted that China's AI technology is a source of confidence and a promising avenue for building resilience in global trade.

Qiu Weiwen, a manager from SKYTECH, demonstrated the intelligent system in front of a large screen. "China has the most complete industrial chain in the world, which makes its export product system rather complex, and that's why we've designed an AI system," he explained.

For new energy vehicle products, it is necessary to input the origins of components like tires, bearings, and battery cells. Even small changes in parameters can result in different solutions from the large model.

"The country where the product is assembled might be different from where its components are produced. We can help you analyze which scenario is more advantageous," Qiu said.

Another service from the Nanjing firm in east China supports European Union-bound exporters by automating carbon footprint reporting and carbon tariff calculations. Beyond compliance, SKYTECH further delivers strategic guidance enabling clients to capture revenue opportunities through carbon trading schemes.

At a CISCE roundtable on Friday, SKYTECH spotlighted a success story. Under its support, Chinese solar-panel maker Trina Solar built a low-carbon, digitally optimized line that slashes the carbon footprint of its modules well below France's entry threshold, unlocking instant access to the European market.

In the neighboring booth, tech stars from east China's Zhejiang Province were unveiling their smart new products, and one of them was NetEase's AI agent for foreign trade firms.

The NetEase Foreign Trade Express uses "AI employees" to develop overseas customers, with precise inquiries increasing by 30 percent. The AI can automatically identify target customers with an accuracy rate of over 95 percent, saving foreign trade companies up to 1.5 working days per week in customer search time.

Last October, Alibaba International updated its "AI Business Assistant," enabling real-time optimization of product titles, keywords, images and selling points to drive more online exposure for home-made products for overseas market.

Veteran Chinese mechanics maker Xu Jingqian recalled a puzzling challenge with his screw compressors: strong website traffic in the United States but poor buyer inquiries on Alibaba.

As an early adopter of Alibaba's AI tool launched in 2023, he received targeted recommendations: Add U.S. specifications, showcase product certifications and clarify door-to-door delivery costs. After implementing these changes, Xu saw his sales more than double.

"AI now auto-translates Chinese small enterprises' product descriptions into export-ready visuals and listings, making global sales as easy as domestic ones," said Fan Min, general manager of public affairs at Alibaba 1688, at a CISCE event.

The introduction of these new products underscores China's ongoing efforts to sustain the global trade system via digital tools despite increasing uncertainties. Empowered especially by AI technology, the thriving digital trade is emerging as a bright spot in global trade landscape.

At the five-day expo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised China's global leadership in AI models, engineering talent and industrial applications. "The supply chain of China is a miracle. It is the largest and most complex in the world, not just about labor, but built on deep technology, AI and software," said Huang.
